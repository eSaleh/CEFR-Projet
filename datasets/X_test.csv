      I just finish my highschool, but I need a great score at the english test to be ingeneer. After that I could do a lot of things. Also my first idea is to have a lot of experience and knowledge. In a lot of countries, it is possible to do formation for improve your knowledge, cultur or language. So, I think if I can do it during 2 or 3 years, it will be a good jump for my career.

      Dear Jane, How are you? We haven't seen for ages. I'd like to tell you something, but keep a secret, don't tell anyone! I heard that Alice, who were with us at the University, moved to Africa and now have a family there! She called me from Nigeria yesterday night and told me everything. It's amazing!  However, she won't that eveybody knows her story. I think she is really happy: she has a very good family and she is working in the local hospital. She has two children who go in France on all holidays. Given the advanced age of her parents, they decided to stay in France, it's more comfortable. See you soon, Take care. Kate.

      First, I give you a frisbee. On each turn you can take two shots. You will try to shots the bottles and each bottle that is knocked down you win one point. But if you get a &quot;strike&quot; ,that is to say all the bottles are knocked down, you win two more shots and all the points are added together. the winner is the player who have the most points.

      I hate the TV and her programs. I never watch and I try to explain my children that it's unintersting. Sometimes they watch TV but just a short moment. It's difficult to give my opinion because I don't know the programs. I think that there isn't educational programs at all. If you want to learn somethink there are a lot of books and it's easy to read them. For the children, school is better than TV to learn and if you want to open their mind it's possible to travel with them or to go in museum or exhibitions.

      Last week, I ate at a five stars restaurant with my girlfriend. I took italian lasagna as a main course. Before I tasted it, it sounded very delicious. And effectively it was. It came with some asparagus and green beans that was locally grown. The dessert I took was wonderful: a tiramisu. You know, when the tiramisu's well cooked, you spend a great time tasting it. It was the case, that tiramisu reminded me my vacation in Turino when I met my girlfriend in a local restaurant. An other point is that  the server was very polite and helpful. She always asked us if we wanted a help or something else.

      Right, to summarize our last weekly presentation with our CEO about our team relationship and economy growth, let me start with the key point, the opening of our market in London, it'll allow us to increase by 20% our market share. So, at the next step, the speaker showed us in a pie chart sales's percentage we increase to 5% from 2% of the last month. Another thing they said was we are going to hire a new COO to keep and improve our team building, by the way I'm really happy because the presenter was very clear and their charts were compelling and no one had concerns about it. Finally, if they had made an exiting conclusion we would have liked it. Overall they thanked for all people who have come.

      Hi Mr. Balague,  The meeting was very interesting, about the new products for the family's holidays. The team as made a new brochure with holiday rental, as campsites, with activities for children, packaging with discount on the price for the children, and sometimes, children are free of charge, even in the high season! I think that new brochure will permit to develop a new market and attract new customers. Unfortunately, it will be hand out in only 2 weeks, so it will be hard to communicate and advertise about it until the deadline. I've started the emailing today, but for the other things, the pictures are not available yet! I will give you more information on time.  Best regards,  Sandy

      Greg, my husband-in-law and I, really enjoy a restaurant named &quot;Salad &amp; Co&quot;. We discovered it for about a year, and we ate there 3 weeks ago for the last time. Organic food is the concept of the restaurant. The waitress welcomes us and gives us a card according to the chosen formula: one for the unlimited salad sideboard, another one for the plancha meal. Each formula includes unlimited drinks on water fontain, sparkling or not, and with different flavoring, and unlimited dessert. We chose both the first formula, including fresh soup, and ordered a pressing orange juice, in extra. It was so delicious!! A great pleasure with no sense of guilty!

      I am 43 years old and I can say I am probably at half of my life.  What I learned of those past years is that life is short and therefore there is no time to loose in unuseful disputes or behavior. I just try to be happy in each single moment of my life and to find what is the good of every thing. I am curious and interested in many subjects . I like to learn many things from people. The only thing I need to accept is that I won't be able to discover all what I would like to in this world. If I had a suggestion to give to others, that  will be  to suggest them just to live as they want to live but just without forgetting that we are on earth for a limited time and that life can stop at anytime.

      Product write-up The new electronic dictionary is bigger than the others. I tried it out myself and I thought it was great. But, before you run out to buy one, think about the price. I could not believe my eyes when I saw how much they were asking for it. I was rolling on the floor laughing so much it hurt! Well, that is not exactly true. But, if I were you, I would buy the bigger version; it has a better value for sure. You can not deny the fact that it is the best bang for your buck! Harry

      I used SWOT but I didnt know the acronym. It was helpful for projects management. I remember the time when some people wanted to create their own business. We started with their dreams, a word that doesn't sound very trendy in crisis time, but their dreams were their roots, their energy, the sense of their life. How did they feel with them? It was our way to connect them with their strengths. Then we had a look on the environment. The aim was to focus on strengths and opportunities, and help them to work together. Some people could only see their weaknesses and external threats, which is a depressive posture that may drive to suicide. As we worked in group where everyone wanted the success of the others, little by little most people became aware of the interest of getting more confident in themselves and the others. Working on this base made the following work easier: settings, marketing study, regulations, organization and so on. It was the best way to prevent failure feeling. Nobody failed but was trying to find his own way to achievement.

After that you can order a main course with three options : steak, salmon or chicken. The dishes comes with peas, rice or baked potatoes. The dessert are authentic and sounds good. My best choice is the apple served with ice cream but if you prefer fresh desser you would take the lemon sorbet or the strawberris.

      Do you know all the definitions of the word &quot;discrimination&quot;? To your mind, how can you define discrimination? Have you ever been discriminated in the past? Or do you know someone who was victim of discrimination? If yes, what was the nature of the discrimination? Was it direct or indirect? Have you ever used disrimination against a woman because of her gender? Or her type of skin? If yes, what was the reason of this act? For you, what kind of discrimination is the most usual nowadays? And last question, do you think that discrimination occures more or less today and why?

      On overall, I'm quite optimistic about the futur. I think that health care will be better thanks to the technology improvement. The new teleconferencing systems will contribute to decrease the polution by enabling the companies to schedule fewer business trips. However, we will have to take care about a potential risk: the increase of the rate of unemployment due to the replacement of men by robots.  Unless a particular attention is bring to this risk,  this one will lead to a further deterioration of the quality of life and an increase of insecurity in developing countries.

As side order, I took a fried rice. It was delicious but I don't know if the food there was free-range and organic. As desert, I took a mixed sorbets: lemon and coconut. The restaurant is open until midnight so it's very convenient for a student like me.

      Sandra, I just want to give you a little summary of our negociations. It was very hard! You remember that we needed 300 laptops, the fastest model. The full price was so high: $1,000 per unit: it was out of the question. After a first meeting, the vendor proposed us an offer with a bulk discount: $925 per unit. It was out of our budget, again. The vendor tried to convice us that it was the lowest price they can propose for this model... So, in the week, I checked with Sam if another company could sell us these laptops for a lower price. It was impossible. Finally, the next week, the vendor maked a counteroffer: 300 laptops, the standard model, at $700 each. So we have concluded for this price. It's a more resonable choice. See you tomorrow

      Sometimes awkward situations can happen very easily, like when you're at family lunch, on a sunday for exemple, and you have to introduce your new girlfriend or boyfriend. From that point, things can be very complicated ! Most of the time, it happens like that : there is a nice table, with all the nice cutlery of your parents, and if you have brothers or sisters, they're also here. Everyone is well dressed, and the food is wonderful. Everybody made an effort, and feel good. But comes the time of questions to your girlfriend or boyfriend : What are you doing in your life ? What are you planing to be after school ? (for those who still are students) Do you want to get married one day ? Have you ever think about having children ? Etc... This is so awkward ! And of course, your parents don't see it that way, not a big deal for them! But you come to rescue your beloved and tell them it's not of their business ! Then everybody hope that awkward situation won't come by again before the end of the lunch... So are you !

      Gender issues Ive never understood stereotypes about women and men. For me, there isnt much of a difference between both. But almost everybody doesnt have much of an opinion. For instance, in France cause of media and domestic education with traditional values, gender determines your behavior. I find there is a sort of regression like women: - are weaker than men and hate sport - have to take care of their children, clean and cook instead of repeating absence from their work while men should share housework at fifty percent - are feminist whereas they defend their own rights - love the pink color Even if, sometimes women are considered as a handicap, Im very proud to be one. Because women are leadership, they are the bedrock of society. Things are changing! We are here and we will change the world!

      Hi, Anna! I've found an absolutely amazing job for you. Let me tell you why you should apply for it. First of all, I want to let you know this is totally the job for you, I mean you'd work outdoor sharing a great contact with animals daily. I guess working as a Zookeeper must be an exhilarating and exciting job, so i urge you to just go for it. Make a bid and you'll see. Plus, it's by far the most well paid job i've seen in the ads including one month holiday every year and a full accident insurance, you won't have to worry giving them one of your finger for the desert. (haha I'm joking)PS: (Bonus) you'll be offering regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocs. Pretty good, huh? Talk to you soon! Can't wait to see you, XoxoAnthony.

      My name is Anna. I was born in 1964. When I was young, I lived in Paris . I studied dance from 1971 to 1981 in elementary and high school. I worked and studied hard because I dreamt to be a star dancer. I always went to bed very late and I got up at 6:30 every day. But in July, 9th 1981, when I danced, I fell over and broke my feet. All my dreams was over ! I cried a lot and was so sad. My parents and I moved to Madrid and I studied Psychology. Now, I live in Nice, I work in hotel. I stared to work in sightseeing after to travel around the world. Sometimes, life is surprising. I met my boyfriend in England and I married him in January. He was a dancer !

      I remember my first steps with technology; when I was eight years old, my mother bought me a cellular. It was a Nokia 32.10. I didnt use it a lot because at this time, nobody had a cellular phone. Few years after that, we acquired a computer with Internet. My friends and I was all day and all night on msn, an application to chat with your friends. I remember this period as a marvelous. We felt so close from each other because we could share personal things just writing in the front of a computer. It was easier to communicate. We didnt feel ashamed. I feel touched when I think to the beginning of all this technology. Now, we have very good products like Ipad, Iphone, Kindle, HD tv or even Imac. It is very useful for the everyday life; we couldnt live without that. The problem is everybody is twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week in the front of a screen. We are becoming more and more selfish and individualists. We do not take time to communicate with each other unless it is a telephonic conversation. The life is absolutely not the same, neither for me or someone else.%%

      Skyfall is probably the most accomplished opus of the James Bond Saga. Ian Fleming would hardly have imagined that his hero would meet such a destiny. In Skyfall, the world balance of power is threatened by the worst evil man. The plot begins in Asia and rapidly sets in London where MI6 itself suffers bewildering events. Daniel Craig play the role of James Bond for the third time after Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace and has still this tortured charm which makes him my favourite embodiment of the most famous english spy. The plot is terrifying and accompanied with a lot of stunts thrilling the spectator during the whole film. The original soundtrack sang by Adele serves perfectly the different action scenes.

      My favorite game is a card game but a little bit special. There is a game master who organized the game. The rules are easy, there are the villagers and the werewolves, each players take a characters and try to kill all the werewolves and all the villagers. The game starts and all the players have to close eyes, it''s night and the game master calls the werewolves who are allowed to open the eyes and allowed to designate a player who will be kill. The newt day, all the players have to open the eyes and the game master show one player who was killed by the werewolves. The players have to discuss and kill an other player. The villagers and the werewolves have not the same interest and there are a lot of bluff. I love this game.

      I live in france, in paris. I find that in my country and particularly in paris, people are generally stressed by the work and by their problems' life. Besides, it would seem that France is the country where the consumption of antidepressants is the highest in Europe.  In their job, french works a lot. Their schedule are from about 9 o'clock in the morning to 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. By contrast, in generally, they take long time for lunch, around one hour and half and they usually take a lot of breaks, approximately 3 breaks a day. As regards their lifestyle, I think that french is one of the country where people have a good lifestyle. Indeed, french generally makes exercices, they eat healthly, go to their doctors often. On this point, they are better than other countries.

      I graduated from high school with a background in literature. Subsequently, I had been going to university, to study foreign languages. Nevertheless, I had the impression that something was missing in my life. I wanted to do something which could allow me to surpass myself, and by the same way make me useful for the others. By chance, I stumbled about an armed forces advertisement, which turned out to be an important turning point in my life. Indeed, I joined the army to serve and protect my country. After five years of good and loyal service, I decided to quit. I had to find a new occupation. When I was a soldier, I got my class E license. It helped me a lot to apply for some job advertisements which were looking for a truck driver. Soon afterward, I got a job. Currently, I work as a re-fueller in an airport. I've been working there for ten months, but I already plan to do something different. Indeed, I want to be a steward, so I'm going to take a flight attendant training next month. I hope everything is going to be ok.

      I have learn English all my life. My country, Cameroon is bilingual, we have two national languages: French and English. So in class we are obliged to learn English. Unfortunately, English is not enough weight in our school program: about one or two hours per week. So at the end of high school we still have a lot of children who are not bilingual. They have to improve their English. I am part of these children. I still need to increase my English. Indeed, my missed interview for an accountant position has opened my eye about the need for improving my English. In fact I have loose this interview because of my level in English was not enough. Since this day I have begun to increase my English by enrolling in englishtown.fr, by reading every day English news and by watching English documentary. All these things together have really helped me. Now, I can speak more fluently and clearly understand what I'm reading.

      Hi dear, I booked my flights last week before leaving NY. The journey was long but I have taken a non-stop flight. I was quite tired when I arrived the next day in Dusseldorf. I visited the city and drank a lot of beers, german people were very friendly. I took the last flight to London because the airport shuttle bus broke down 2 kms before the airport! I ran to check in in time. In the flight, the air hostess was impolite with all the passengers. Since yesterday, I'm in Oslo in Sweden. I planned my week-end.

      In my opinion, corporate social responsability is an important concept. Indeed, I do believe that companies have a strong impact on its peoples' lives and on society thus a responsability. On the one hand, a job is an important part of a peolple's life. It is a part of his identity, his public identity, his role in the society. I think most people are really involved in their company, it seems logical that companies should be involved in their people's welfare too. An employee who is taken care of will give 100% of his capacity to the company. The workforce efficiency can be really enhanced this way. CSR also concerns environmental responsability. I think companies could play a big role in climate change slowdown, if they wanted to, or ought to. Maybe some changes in legislation would enable waste reduction, hazardous chemicals ban, energy savings, and a lot more. One the other hand, the first goal of a company is profit and economical profitability. Shareholders will always pressurize to increase their rate. Finally, I still think it would not be tragic for big companies and their shareolders to reduce their profit by 0.01% to spend the money on CSR.%%

      i am not really optimistic for the future. Indeed, even if the technology will be still more developping, the social problem could be the same in five, ten or twenty years. Yes, it is good this technology development, and in particular for the evelopping world, but problems are numerous. There is this social problem against no trobot can do something, but there is too the problem of gasoline and renewable energy. If we don't progress in the sustainable developmentand even if the pollution decrease, in theory, in the next years, the future is uncertain.

Suddenly a blood-curdling shout makes everyone to stop, everything seems frozen, and everybody looks at the house of the new family who just arrived two days earlier.Who could think money was the motivation of a murder in such place? Who could think someone would die at daytime from a jewel-encrusted dagger as weapon? Is the convict really the good one? The secrets of a strange family can be out of imagination.

At the same time, the national sales have increased to only 1m the first year and have remained constant all the next year. In 2006, the sales volumes were quite the same for both national and international sales. Since 2006, the national sales have fluctuated. After a steadily increase from 1m to 3m, level reached in the beginning of 2007, the sales fell rapidly under 2m and are now still decreasing but very slowly. During the same period, the international never stopped to decrease or remain stable at a low level, around 1m or less.

And bellow I will first summerize the results of these missions, than I will try to explain the reasons of the failure and finaly I will end by some actions to be led.Protests from civilians and troops in exercise play added to violent disputes between some civilians observers and finaly diplomatic disapproval are the consequences of different thingsfinaly : first, the late decision about the contents of political messages in the leaflets didn't help to have a clear and easy understandable message.Why this poor result? Some reproaches could be made about the timing of these operations. Not enough time was taken to prepare the contents of the leaflets. And for sure the personnel in the civil exercise cell wasn't experienced enough and wasn't enough numerous. It is difficult to deal with three different languages and some mistakes have been done without speaking of the wrong sites used for the dropping.So clearly precautions have to be taken to improve our capacity to lead such missions.- amelioration of the briefings quality- avoid possibility of missunderstanding due to different languages- dead lines to be respected by everyone- scheduled plan with timing for future missionsThank you for your attention.

      I wonder if there are manners and etiquette to respect nowadays. I think, it might depend on your social class or the one of the persons who organise the dinner party. I belong to a family of industry workers and little farmers and my parents always receive people from the same class. There is no real etiquette to follow, no special attention to have toward a person regarding her job or the money she has. But, there is a natural and mutual respect, because nobody has an easy life and everyone do his best. Words that are used are normal ones and, in these occasions, there is a tendancy to try and avoid slang language and too familiar words. Depending on the presence of grandparents or children, technical language or adults word are less used, I mean internet or sms language and sexual humor. A natural politeness guide our behavior without exageration or hyprocrisy.

      A new year is always a challenge. To make of the year 2014 a successful one I think it's time for us to do a SWOT analysis. We have different kind of strengths in our company such as the experience of the team, the quality of our products and a good knowledge of the market  but we have some weaknesses too. We are not a big company compare to our competitors and we have regularly to face some financial problems. That's the reason why we must consider all the opportunities and threats with the greatest attention so as to take the good decisions for future. I'd like our team to take one day for a brainstorming that will be helpful to help us to find these opportunities and how to use them for the company but also to consider the different kind of threats we could have to face in the coming years. I suggests we all meet together next Monday 8.00 AM in my office for that brainstorming. Thanks per advance. PB

To start, I'd like to tell you that there love story is a youthful romance. While they still were students they already shared a common interest which is a passion for song and music. To pursue their higher education, they often had to be far from one another for long periods of time. But never has time or distance altered their relationship. Their patience and desire to well organize such an event is a good indication of their respect for marriage. Hugh and Samuella, I believe that your couple will be a source of inspiration for family, friends and colleagues. I wish you to have as many children as you want and to be successful in your assignments for the generation we're living in. Could we please all stand up and raise our glasses to Hugh and Samuella!

      I'm really optimistic about the future. I think robots will take place from humans. Unless the laws don't allow this technology, the robots will take care and help sick people. Teleconferences will be an other type of medical care, the proposal of this idea is to heal hurts people who live so far from the hospital and the access to there isn't easy. If this technology goes on, a lot of people will live better.

      I just heard a song by Josh Woodward called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. That's a country music song and it's beautiful. The tune is quite catchy and the melody is addictive. The singer can't really hit high notes, but it doesn't matter because the tune is catchy too. I think it's a sad song. The lyrics are political. The singer regrets his life before. He doesn't accept the fact that life can change because of new technologies or life improvement. In fact some people have to find new jobs and move out of their town. We can't live in the past, we must have goals in our lives. If you are interested in political lyrics, you will appreciate this song and the beat is great.

      I like my life. However, it isn't easy sometimes. I actually very happy with my family. I have a wonderful wife and daughter. We have already paid our house. I have everything that I wanted. But I voluntary left my job 3 months ago. I've worked for 18 years in the same factory. It isn't easy to take this decision, but I did it and for the moment I don't regret even if I'm earning less money. I think it's normal to stop sometimes if we can have the choice of course. However, time to time, I have a certain amount of stress. I sometimes wonder if my decision was the best or the worst of my life. I think it was the best because I should work in February. In a result I should get a better job than before with a better payroll. This interruption is very beneficial although I don't work. In fact I can take advantage of my months off to learn English. I'm trying to do it around 3 hours a day. I love this language but my weakness is the oral comprehension I think.

      I would say, it's difficult to be a leader. You have to deal with many problems; First of all if you will be a good leader you have to learn it. Best is to follow a training course, where you learn how to manage your employees. You have to be clear , strong but not to much. You must drive your employees; They muss believe in you and feel good at work. Your personal has to respect you but not to be afraid of you if they make mistakes. You must be their confident but also their dirigent.You also must take the time to speak with them if there is a problem. ans never do what my boss use to do : thinking he's the best and a woman's idea is never a good idea. He also underestimate some of this employees and more ;  he does not treat all his employees the same way.

      This topic is very interesting because I do trust that success is linked with passion and vision.  The movie &quot;Jobs&quot; is a good reminder about successful people ! In my mind, I do admire Justin Timberlake. He owes his success to his talent but also to his passion. Singer and Dancer he is today an Actor, a Model, a Business Man, a Charity Union's President... On the other hand I do admire my mother because she believes in my brother and I and boost us in any of our projects life to get success. My younger brother has been studying design for 6 years and he is currently in India to perform his skills and knowledge. I am sure that his passion and curiosity could make him different to be a success person too. To sum up, the success persons I admired are from different background but as one things in common : passion !

      I recently attended a presentation about the urban development in France.The presenter was the former mayor of Dijon, an important city in France. He was an excellent speaker, like most of the politicians. He spoked , without staring at his notes and looked at people around all the time.His opening was excellent. His first joke, wich worked well was tremendous to grab attention and he gave the audience a very clear plan. On the other hand, he did'nt emphasized enough his main ideas. One thing he could have done differently was to release more facts and figures. He remained at a level of generality. If he had given us more examples, more visuals, or more charts, we would have better remember his main ideas.  As he developped the consequences of urban deccay an the positive perspectives of urban renovation, he delivered a boring speech, without real cities of flesh and blood.I'm still not sure to have understood the purpose of his statement. In the conclusion, he failed to summarize her keypoints.I'm not sure we learned a lot.

      Joyful people are popular : they keap smiling and always find out solutions for problems. They are active and quickly make anything they have to do. They are very positive. They like to arrive on time to their office in the morning. They like to be busy and they like to help others. I am joyful because I like working and being efficient whenever I have something to do. I Can't understand for what reason some people like complaining all the time. If you keep thinking about your problems, you attract them and your problems get bigger and bigger. If you want to be happy you must look for positive points in your life everyday. This point is important for your business but aswell for your personal life. I like when people is happy. I apprciate when the company where I work make important benefits then everybody is happy and can see the result of all the efforts made. To be happy keep smiling when it rains : flowers need rain to grow. When you are stack in a traffic jam, thing about what you had to do today : did you do everything ? If not, what did you forget or what do you still have to do for tomorrow ?%% Make a list of it.

      Dear Mr Righter, Following your last email, I'm glad to send you the reasons of my application. Why I want to study online: It's mostly because of the flexibility it offers. I'm working to a tight schedule, so I can't afford to be in a normal school with fixed tuition. Also, I feel well with new technologies, so the combinaison of these two reasons made me make out that choice. Subjects I would like to study: I was going to study on how the bees communicate with each other, then I realized studying English could be a better choice for my professionnal life. And then, who knows ? Maybe even bees are talking english to communicate. What I hope to achieve with an online study program: I do think the technologies are now mature enought to provide a real & efficient learning environment. I'm considering achieving a complete tuition, and I would like to know if your online program delivers certificates. My aim is divided into two parts: self-development and professional advancement. I want to go up on the ladder of my carrer, and I think your school is a good choice to achieve this. I hope I have fully replied to all your questions, don't hesitate to contact me if you want me to deepen any of these points. Best regards Arno G.

      Obviously, I can honestly consider that I have a comfortable life and a wonderful family! Although unemployment has dramatically increased in my country, I have got an interesting job and my husband too. We are both active and working as teachers at the same high-school in which the whole atmosphere is very pleasant. We like our job because we like the connection with adolescents. Well, most of the students who are attending the high-school are quiet and well educated so,  teaching them every day provides us a great satisfaction. Moreover, even if we have to be thrifty to manage to pay off the mortgage, we live in a comfortable house with our three children. Compared with the stressful life in Paris, living there,near the Ocean is a real pleasure and we often enjoy walking up by the sea on Sundays. Anyway, everything would be almost perfect without my daughter's serious illness. She is struggling against cancer since two years which have utterly changed our life and our mind. Nowadays, I am used to thinking that life is made of plenty of very strong quality times that we musn't pass it up because it's called:'HAPPINESS' .%%

      We can observe that the trend of the two lines are opposite. The national sales increased sharply from 2004 to the beginning of 2007 and suddenly dropped for 6 months before going on decrease slightly. As far as the international sales are concerned, we can note a rapid increase between 2004 and mid-2005 followed by a significant and sudden decrease in July 2005. The international sales remained steady until 2007 and dropped again suddenly in February 2007. Since that date, the figures have remained stable. However, national sales remain more important than international sales even though it took a longer time to reach a higher level.

      I will present you results of the sale of books in our compagny for the period between 2004 and 2008. On the one Hand, it will be important to compare the National sales figures and International Sales figures. As you can see from the chart. International sales were more important than the national between 2004 and 2006. It even reached 2.5 million. However trend between both is dramatically reversed since 2006. Thus, international sales have plummeted and sales incresed from National 1 million to 3 million. It is truly remarkable for our compagny. My dear colleagues, we must take the boat in that direction. Good job to all. In the next year to new statistics. Go! at work.

      As a Canadian, I'm proud that our country has produced Cirque du Soleil, which is a one-of-a-kind circus performance. What makes Cirque du Soleil unique is that they make you feel like you're dreaming. The performers wear imaginative costumes and perform thrilling acts that you won't see anywhere else. And, although many circuses use animals, there are no animals in Cirque du Soleil. Apparently, they believe animals should be left in their natural habitats. Between the performances, the inventive music, the set and the costumes, it's hard to know what's best about Cirque du Soleil. It's the most professional, most sophisticated and most complex circus I've ever seen.

      Hello Dillon, Thank you for your propositions. You have a lot of good ideas. But I can't surf and scuba dive because I think it's too dangerous. I like going to the beach and swimming. For me, swimming is relaxing. I don't like football and soccer but I like basketball and badminton. I love playing piano and guitare. I think that the more important is that we will be together for my birthday.%% Seen you soon. Best wiches Valrie

      During our last holidays, near the Mediterrannean sea, we ate in a small restaurant, located on the sea side. The owner explained us that all sea food was fresh and the vegetables were growing, in his own garden. During the Chef was preparing what we ordered, we drinked a glass of champagne. We ate a douzen of oysters as an appetizer, with local dry white wine The main course was a ''Loup grill'' with baked potatoes with the same wine. ''Loup'' is the name of a very tasty fish. We didn't tak salad, prefering the local goat's cheese. We finished with a lemon tart then a coffee. As we drunk a bit too much, the owner said us we could we sat in deck chairs, waiting for the end of the afternoon. All was perfect!

      Well, I'm doing some research to improve most of the companies about the discrimination's issue. So here is my questions: What kind of discriminations exist? I mean there is like different forms of discriminations? What's a direct discrimination? What's an indirect one? Why the gender's discrimination is still a problem in our society? What kind of corporates have more discrimination's cases? How do we process agains a discrimination ? Why the marital status can be a discrimination? Why the maternity leave of the women when they needs it , is subject of discrimination ? What are the feelings of discriminated peoples? how they feel about that ? Can we have a deposition of a person concerned?

Owing to past experiences in my childhood, for me the most important is to get your sights higher. In my life, I'd learned that you have to be ambitious in what whole you do and you wanna do. Every day, I do things for trying to reach my professionnal and private life objectives. And I beleive in. If I may give an advice to others, it would be to beleive in what you do, and what you wanna do in your life.

      My favorite restaurant in my city of origin is the &quot;Tom Pouss&quot;. I think it's the best quality price rate I know ! In my opinion the food is gastronomic but with very reasonable prices. They served french traditional food. Most of their activity is caterer. But all middays they propose specials and the habitual menu. On the other hand about evenings they are opened only tuesday and friday, and the restoration room is really little. So you have to book the morning for lunch. But it's worse concerning friday's evenings given that their success grows. You have to book earlier you can. Enjoy your meal in Tom Pouss Emmanuel's restaurant !

      I am used to puchasing food on a french website instead of spending too much time in the brick-and-mortar stores of the biggest food retailers like Carrefour for example. Indeed, I have found the quality of the products delivered by this website is pretty much higher than the one of the traditional food retailers. Actually, the company, in charge of this website, shops directly at the famous french market in Rungis, which is a guarantee of quality and freshness. Furthermore, it is a good way to avoid losing valuable time in the supermarkets, especially when you have to wait in a queue, and the costs of delivery are offset by the fact you do not have to go to the shops, using your car and so, some fuel. The design of the website is quite attractive with pictures of all the types of food you can buy and the use of modern light colors. All is well understandable, with the description of each product, their current price, the best season to eat them, their weight, their expiry date...Moreover you can choose between various types of delivery methods, at your home, in a dedicated shop closed to your address or at your work.%% Nevertheless, you have to be available in a range of two hours that you must select when you place your order. Obviously, to validate your order you have to select your favorite payment method among the credit card, paypal or cash at delivery, which are all absolutely secured. Unfortunately, I cannot compared this website with another one, of the same kind, because I have never tried others.

      In France, gender equality is a main topic. Why&nbsp;? Because in my country, women has always been fighting for their rights. For instance, there was a huge movment of feminism in the 40's with Simone de Beauvoir and so on, which allowed women to vote, exactly like men, in 1944. Thus, women wasn't only seen like mothers and cookers anymore. But nearly 70 years after, does roles really changed&nbsp;? Not completly. In fact, France has never seen a female president, but half of the minister are females. A lot of high responsabilities in business are hold by men, even if more and more women are leading key roles. Men are still having a biggest salary than woman for the same job (approximatly 12% higher), and in some professions like craftman, women are rear. I think change needs time, but I'm sure that in a few years, gender equality will be a reality.

      When I was growing up, tablets lap-tops and cell phones didn't exist. To search any information like address or phone number we had to use &quot;Minitel&quot;, there was one phone per home and the computer was considered like a luxe item. In the late 90's, appeared the first cell phones and computers. I recall that the both were really heavies, also internet connection was totally unknown. Over 10 years, we've discovered more and more kinds of media, the cell phones became lighters and smarters. Computers have been replaced by lap-tops. In the early 2000's , is arrived a huge wave of technology: Tablets, smart phones, internet connection, on-demand TV, HD TV. Nowadays, you can get any information anytime; anywhere; where you want; where you need.  It's so easy now to get access to internet, it's really difficulft to imagine how could we do in the past? This technology is totally integrated into our daily life, we can't live without it.

      The French like to honour their good food with good presentation and good manners. If you've been invited as a guest to dinner, bring a hostess gift as flowers, a plant or chocolates. At the table in France, manners are important even while eating with your family. Always show up for dinner within ten minutes late. Give a call if you will be any longer than ten minutes late. Drinks won't be served until the last guests arrive.  Here are some helpful tips: Keep your hands on the table, this is very important. Eat with the fork in your left hand, and the knife in the right. Always wait for the host to say &quot;bon apptit&quot; before starting to eat. Most meals come with bread. If you don't have a side plate, putting the bread on the tablecloth beside your plate is fine. Ask for toilets discretly if you need to freshen up. Eventually, always send a thank you note the next day, or phone to say thank you.

One day, my friend went out to work as usual in the morning by taking her laptop computer and her handbag. As I was running down in the street, she saw a young couple getting out of a car. She was so surprised to see vandalism in her neighborhood: the young couple was vandalizing the local newsagents by breaking window and throwing paint on the store front. A few minutes later, she was threatened with a gun when she wanted to persuade them to stop that. She was stounded and same time terriffied when one of young couple was going to shoot her.

If all the innovations will focus on improving the way of life  on the topic of health, transport, eat, then i will have a real optimistic view of the future. By the way, if all innovations are focused on guns, accumulating richness ,then i will be very pessimistic on the future which will be a fountain of desolation

      Yesterday, I went alone to a vegetarian restaurant, not far from my home. I had reserved two days before. Waiters are sympathetic and polite and the meal very tasty and well-prepared. All the food was organic and producted locally in an organic farm. I ate a vegetable soup whith cheese in entry, baked potatoes and a river fish, fished two kilometers hence. I drank a glass of plain mineral water. In dessert, I took a fruit salad, which was very delicious and refreshing. When I payed, I was astonished because the prices didn't are exagerrated at all, despite of the meal quality.

      Dear Mrs Blight, I send you a choice of properties . These houses are a beautiful view on the sea but they are with a different style. The first has the most wonderful sunset but it is smaller and you do need a new roof. The second has a historic story and you have a hotelier licence, you can rent quickly a part of the house. The third is a typical, ideal Greek house in a bright and new residence but you must wait and only to move in within two months . The last it's a luxurious property and a wonderful opportunity, quiet and traditionnal. I hope you will find your house. Don't hesitate to call me to ask me more information. Yours sincerely, Edina Wallace

      This judgement is a bit difficult to establish for me because I hardly ever watch the TV.I select the programs (documentaries or movies)I want to see,and no more. But in my opinion,there are actually too much violent movies that encourage this violence.Why no prohibit them rather than &quot;rating&quot; programs?They will not be seen,so anymore profitable and productors would stop to make them.TV could really be a very &quot;nice object&quot;,provinding education,fun and entertainement.But,unfortunately,a lot of things are rotten by the profit..profit..profit.

I answered : &quot;ok, I understood&quot;, but I understood nothing an I lost the lane. I have been turning around the house since two hours when I met my grand mother who was very worry.

      To study gender differences is interesting in my case because of my orientation. I'm following industrial design studies, specialized in transportation field. Do you think everything is perfect in this world ? Not at all because firstly, the percentage of women is very low; probably under 5%, and there is no women in my class for instance. It's still a macho world. And in an other hand when you're reading some design genesis, why do they always highlight women for their sensibility and any adjectives that is more related to the gender of women ? Who can affirm that a gender is obviously predetermined for a &quot;related&quot; capacity ? I think it's quite a stereotype to associate adjectives with gender. Over the years men and women are getting more equal. However there is still some improvements to do. It's important to allow people to go freely the way they want, without being slow down or stopped by traditional ideas. When a friend - a man- used to be florist, most of people though he was gay. Why do people usually makes such short association ? Why do they not search a bit further than old fashioned society codes ?

      Dear Mr Smith, I was thinking of a new group of animals to add to the cards. The children could play happy families or other games with the cards. A famous saying &quot;dead as a dodo&quot; could be used on one of the cards. I definitely think that could be a good seller. Indeed, in these present days some people are more and more interested in environment issues. Everyone is green today. Furthermore, we already have copyright for many of the animals as we use them in other packs. We do not have a dodo, however, we can probably find pictures out of copyright. I think that costs could be similar or less than our last product. I am willing to be the editor. It would be my first time, but as you know I have got a lot of experience from the African set and Animals of the Americas. I will send an email to John today as we need to meet regarding this project. I am looking forward to meeting with you soon. Best wishes Emmanuelle

      English became an important language in my life. When I was young, I didn't see how it could be and how it will be important for me. English was just a lecture like another. It was boring for me to learn irregulary verbs, and doing grammar. I had preferred studying sciences, thinking it was more useful. But when I grew up, I realised that I was missing something and I was needing english. First, I became passionate by travels. Communicate with people or others travellers is useful when you travel but also very mind-expanding. Subsequently, I started my master's degree in trade and marketing with a mandatory speciality: international. Within business and economy area, english is playing a major role, so, if I wanted to continue my career in this way, I had to learn and improve this language. Learning english is not easy, quick and efficient by following lectures in France...So, I decided to pack and flight to USA for few months, to work and lean directly within an english country. Then, I have down my studies in Ireland. Gradually, I became better. English needs to be practice everyday. I cannot do it at work, so, I travel when I can, I watch my movies or series in original version, and I improve it on englishtown.%%fr! ;)

      Dear Teacher, Going out to see a performing art isn't my favorite hobbie. I live in Paris, a town witch is supposed to be one of the greatest town of the Art. My choice to live in the French capital has been made in 2004. My goal was to find easily a new job. When I was alone, I liked going to the Theater. One day, I saw a piece called &quot;How to be a Parisien in one hour&quot;. It was a French one man show absolutely fabulous. The humorist explained in english the behavior we need to have to become a true Parisien. He urge us to avoid to smile and to be polite, to stay stressful, to whizz in the subway, to be arrogant...  The story was very funny and it was well worth the money. A small price with a funny unknown humorist that I will not forget. It's easy to find a one man show free or at a low price (15) in Paris. In several Theaters, the entrance is free and we can pay what we want. If you like performing arts, Paris is the town you need to live in with all these museums and various Art exposures. Yours Sincerely

The pins are lined up in rows of 4, then 3, 2 and finally 1. Each player has a frisbee and can shot it twice. When you knock down all the pins at the same time, you make a &quot;strike&quot; and win two more shots. The winner is the one with the most points. Don't play this game when it is windy!!!

      First and foremost, France still has nowadays obvious problems about gender equality in its society. Government is working on some solutions to decrease the biggest differences we can meet between gender rights. For example, women don't get the same salary than men yet. In addition, when we talk about families problems, there aren't such any solutions for the victim, as a woman. Women don't have a lot of choices to defend themselves. On the other hand, whithout talking about equal rights through society, the values are very different. I mean you can meet all sorts of opinions when you talk with a man, about the way he communicates, he's polite or he guesses woman's needs. Whereas talking with a woman can be a different approach to see relationships. To condlude, like in the most of countries now, time have changed. But I think we have to think about all possibilities you have to talk and communication whith each other, and understand (or try to) other's opinion.

      If you want to study in Paris. It will be very difficult for you to find a student housing. The rents are very expensive. I advise you to find an university anywhere else.  You shloud try to contact : ERASMUS. This is an institution which can help you to find funding for your studies.  In France, We have a very good education system, publics schools is free. Private University could be more attractive but a lot of them are just interested by your money. you have to be careful.

Aitle must be very important because he defines how the film will be .It's not only a summary.It's more than that.You have to think about, how a screenplay could take place. So, the story must be intresting and pleasant. You have to choice a film maker,different assistants, all technicians that you need, etc...The producer had to be choosen because without money you can't do whatever you want. After that, pick a good actors and actress could be very difficult, because theysupport the movie. The actors must have understanding ascenario and find a way to play their roles.A good environment, facilitate the adaptation to everyone, in the movie .Each person, have to play his role, in front of the scene if there are some actors, or behind the scene if there are some technicians.And now let's go: Action.

      David has good decision-making skills, when he is under pressure. Often he puts off passing key information to co-workers or keeping up with paperwork. He has the ability to work in a team but it seems like he have fallen out with one or two of his team members since the exhibition. Not always good at listening to other people's ideas, but he has lots of creative ideas himself. I'm not sure if we'll regret promoting him so soon. But its awesome to have David as my supervisor. He's so interested in IT.He's searching on the internet, always wanting to find some new stuff for his computer and he also showed me some social networking sides. David's very fun to go on the road with on overseas trips, I must say. He can get pretty competitive when we're doing joint presentations to clients, and he's been a bit aggressive with me when I've suggested doing things more &quot;by the book.&quot; He's good at solving problems on his own, though he occasionally takes the credit for other people's ideas. I haven't brought this up with him myself yet, but sometimes he's a bit unreliable - turning up late to exhibitions, forgetting to email clients with project updates. So I don't feel I can always count on him. David's been an invaluable member of our soccer team since March 2008. He trains hard and handles feedback well - this is very professional. Especially since he's helped us win the interdepartmental trophy twice now. That was awesome! In large part this is due to his speed and ability to run the length of the pitch without passing the ball to anyone so he can score another goal! He's possibly the fastest one of the fastest player I've ever seen. I think the soccer brings out his aggressive side, especially when he's challenged for the ball, and I heard this shows up in the office, too.

She decided, as a good citizen, trying to stop them damaging the store. And suddenly the long hair girl pointed a gun at her on her stomach, began churning out ideas on mass consumption, before going on, stealing his laptop.

      With the outstanding development of the technologies, I think that the futur can be faced hopefully. Actually, for instance, the health sector has already known a lot of surprising and amazing innovations, so as the robot surgeon called Da Vinci, that never failed during an intervention. Accordingly, I predict that medecine will reach its gold age and that a lot of people will benefit to that paramount step forward. It can be imagined that AIDS would be destroyed soon! Moreover, with the essential problem of the pollution, I am sure that a lot of clean energies will be found and be placed within the reach of all the developped countries (and latter of the whole world). For exemple today a lot of electric cars can be bought, a lot of charging stations are built in the foremost cities, furthermore the increasing price of petrol encourages people to buy it. Pollution also would be an ancient scourge. In conclusion, it can be noticed that a lot of other sector can be mentioned so as the aeronautics, the IT sector or else in the communication. Although the futur is scary, I don't think people must be pessimistic, after all being pessimistic is not good for the health!%%

It seems that people who have a blackberry (for instance) are afraid to switch it off so that they are bound to their managers or their friends and relatives all day long. I don't want to be a modern slave. These kinds of apparels create &quot;needs&quot; that are time eaters and useless for a major part. Time goes too fast to be lost with technologies generating stress, illusion or even addiction. And they affect health more and more often .

      Hi Ian, I've just read a leaflet concerning claustrophia and possible treatments. That furthermore convinces me that you should keep your job and try to cope with your current phobia rather than resign. I've understood that phobia is an irrational fear in enclosured areas that brings you the feeling of a dangerous situation. That triggers anxiety, panic and the physical symptoms connected : sweating, racing heart, shaking... I was very interested in the second part of the article dealing with solutions regarding to this problem. I suggest you look at them and experience the treatments proposed. I'm sure that ought to help you to manage your fears. You could try the behavioral therapy with the support of a Therapist who will learn you to develop a positive attitude and make you feel as safe as possible. You could also try meditation and relaxation to deal with the physical symptoms.%% What do you think about it? Are you ready to begin? See you soon

      What do I think about the new Josh Woodward song &quot;Home Improvement&quot;? At first, one notices that it is a distinctive song, since there is not just Josh with his guitar, but a full arrangement. As his other songs, &quot;Home improvement&quot; is politically involved. It denounces consumerism and highlights that progress doesn't always lead to joy and happiness.I really enjoyed the message of this song even if the musical arrangement makes the song sound a little bit too commercial for me. I'm afraid that most of Josh's fans will feel the same way...

She's always the very first to arrive in the morning and the very last to leave in the evening and we can easily say that all the time she spends at the office is for dealing with her files and nothing else. However, although her office's door is always open, no one dare enter into it. Indeed, Aurelia appears to be snobby and has no relationships with her team. And here is the key problem: she's a manager but does not manage. She appears to flee in front of any problem or conflict that may arise instead of tackling or trying to solve it. The persons she is supposed to manage suffers from this lack of consideration which entails for them a lack of self-confidence and motivation.

It was about a lot of his paintings and it was kind of boring, as the woman who spoke was very slow, I mean, she spoke slowly and with te same tone. Furthermore, something that was really annoying was that when she was speaking, something in her mouth made a weird noise because of her saliva. Concerning her presentation itself, it was really boring because we only saw paintings, nothing else ! She didn't do any conclusion, she just thanked us and we went away. The worse of all is that she showed us all the paintings while we were supposed to see them afterwards ! It was the most boring presentation I've ever been too ! One more thing is that she was so uninteresting that everyone was sleepong, even the teachers who came with us !

      The last time I went to a restaurant was early June, in Paris. The weather was great so we could put ourselves (my friend and I) in terrace. Quickly, the waiter came and asked us what we wanted for lunch. Our neighbours were having a steak which seemed delicious so we asked for the same meal. And indeed we did not regret our choice : we had the perfect rare steak. Even if this main course was quite huge, we took dessert to have a sweet taste for the end of our lunch. His brownie and my chocolate cake were... wonderful! I did recommend this restaurant to all my relatives and friends! I have already gone again there twice this month.

      Hi, Simon. I'm writing to tell you what I thought about Jim's sales presentation. One thing he did well was to deliver an inspiring conclusion. I think that he made us all feel motivated to go get new clients after the presentation. I also thought his flowcharts were compelling. They helped make all the sales procedures clear. And I have to admire his excellent speaking ability. His voice was strong as he emphasized the key points. One thing he could have done differently was to explain more about the new executive team. If he had explained the reasons for the changes, we would have been less shocked to find out about the new CFO and COO! I also would have liked it if he had mentioned the topic of the presentation during his opening. At first, I didn't know what he was talking about. Overall, Jim did a great job, and I'm sure his presentation will help us increase sales. Sincerely, Mehdi

      Hi Renee! I have received the survey. When I looked this survey I am agree with the viewer's answers but I think I'm not a viewer like the others. Indeed, It's shown that news is the most watched but in my case I looked less and less news because it's always to see murder and violence. Furthermore, I look a lot of documentaries about nature, countries that help me to travel. In my age group, (19-30) sitcoms is the most watched, I think it's the reality and I like them also.

      I recently attended a presentation about team procedures. For beginning, the speaker well-presented the topic. Then, he presented the keys points. He was no stress, and he spoke clearly in order to all make attention to him. The room was full, and everyone stays until the end of the meeting. The presentation seemed good. Indeed the speaker presented a slide show with several charts. However, the slide show was a little bit long with too much information. Furthermore, the speaker forgot to ask, if someone had any queries regarding the different points. At the end of the presentation, the speaker came to me, in order to know if the presentation had been well-presented. I told him, if you let they ask any question, the meeting would have been more interesting.

I would answer to your last question about someting strange happended to me. I remenber like it was yesterday. The date, easy to remenber: it was the 28th april 2011, my weeding's burthday. So this day I went to my job normaly, and arround 10 o'clock, someone called me to tell me that my daughter had broken his noze in playing rudgy at her school, and I had to pick her to go to hospital.%% Finaly it wasn't very important. We had to get an appointement before lunch for a radio, and togheter we decided to take lunch with my mamy. My parents were surprise, and happy to see us. So, my daughter could come at school, and me at my job. But, in the afternoon, it's my mamy who went to the hospital cause she had a problem with her heart. So I had to leave my job again to see my mamy who finally could come back at home in the evening. So this day was very stressfull, and for finish, probably too happy to come back at home, I let my finger in the door of my car!!! So I don't like this date, but it's true since I'm divorced!!! See you. Marielle

I had to manage the company with less employees and the board decided to merge with a competitor company. 60 people on 125 employes lost their job. At the end of this tough plan, i was also fired for economic raison. In April, I lost my job and a part of my income (44%). Fortunately in France we have social insurance named &quot;Pole Emploi&quot;, they still payed monthly to me 57% of my former salary during 3 years or still I recovered a new job. Lukily, at this time, i had manage to have no mortgage to pay and I had somme money to have food on the table for my two daughter and my wife. I built a restricion plan of my expenses and I worked at looking for a new job. It spend 6 month to find things seemed to be turning around again. A new company of Burgundy, (650 km far from my home) enlisted me in November of 2007.

He looked at all the people around the room and I felt at ease and interested. At the end of his presentation, his conclusion was very clear with a summarise of the key points and a big finish. On the other hand, his flowcarts was not really clear and his serious was too much for the topic of this presentation. If he had introduced differently his presentation, I think more people would have been really motivated for the team building.

      I'm totally agree with the law in Australia regarding the use of cellphone while driving. This law permit to have less accident on the road. Contrary, in France the law permit the use of cellphone while driving only if the conductor use a hands-free kit. I think it's not a good idea because even a person use a hands-free kit, this person isn't totaly concentrate on the road and so, there is a bigger risk of accident. Finally, I think that in France, the law should be as strict as the law in Australia.

One day, after the lunch, we were visiting on foot the seaside near Biarritz. On a car park, we saw 2 simple cars with 3 or 4 persons with sun glasses and phones. They looked like some body guards waiting a very important person. Someone said to us that these cars were the Jacques Chirac's cars, our President of French Republic. He was lunching in the restaurant opposite with the local deputy and the President of the rugby club, two famous personnalitis well-known in France. We waited a little, and suddenly, we saw the 3 personnalitis going out and heading to the cars. Before of enter, the President went to us and with a big smile shook hands with us and said some pleasant words about the weather.

      &quot;Home Improvement&quot; is sung and writtent by Josh Woodward. He is an American folk songwritter, a cowboy of modern times.His song is very emotional but not really sad, it's a grave song. The guitar accompanies his voice unless, is it the opposite. His voice is soft, but also catchy. I think that he wants to grab people's attention about our life choices, and our behaviours.Josh sings with a lot of nostalgia, he expresses his sadness of pasts.In any case, this song wakes our consciousness and, it'svery pleasant to meditate.I like the song, the words, the melody and the singer.

      White Space Associated Refuse rival's claims In a bold move yesterday afternoon, the CEO of WSA denied claims from a rival company that shares prices dropped dramatically. This claims were made by Charles Lewis, the CEO of Better Homes without any foundations. WSA beat out 100 others others to built Mishima Corporations new HQ in Tokyo because WSA design perfectly represent the Mishima criteria &quot;beautifully and exquisitely&quot;. Charles Lewis [CEO of Better Homes] should be sure of his facts before making such outrageous and incendiary claims. To Better Homes we can say:  &quot;stick to what you do best&quot;. Meanwhile White Space will continue to do what we do best, building for the future.

      The laptop my husband offered me for my last birthday is wonderful.  First of all, It is much faster than my old deskstop and I love its color: white. When I carry it, I find it is smart. By the time, I have never had a smartphone. I fear becoming too dependant with it. But, next year, I think I'll get one for my birthday. I'll try to be not overwhelming. I'll try also not to write texts all the day because I don't like when my children, my friends or my hysband spend their time like that. It sounds like to be impolite even if it is perfectly common nowadays. In addition, I think to be available at anytime by everyone is a double-edged sword. But, despite that, it's very exciting to own a smartphone and to experience all the nex features it owns.

      In France, communication are a little special. The form of the expression depend to the context of the conversations. We often use an informal langage to speak with our friends, collegues or familly. But we use formal langage in many situation, when we meet a person for the first time for example. French are often quite direct when they wanna say something important. French langage is very diffficult to learn due to its grammar and all its expressions. The body langage is really important to, the topic of something we say can completely change according to the tonality or the face expression. We wave our hands to thanks, say good bye and to report our presence. To say &quot;hello&quot; we often shake hands for the first meet and a cheek kiss for well known persons ( more with girls). French use a lot email and phone to speak with others.

      I live in France. In my country it's used to answer quickly for an invitation, and confirm just a few days before the &quot;D day&quot;, just to be sure you really come. You can make a little gift, like bottle of vine or bunch of flowers; it's always appreciated by the host. After the party you can send a little message to thanks you hostess and tell her how her party was nice. In this day and age you can send a Texto, or SMS, to thanks her. I've recently learned that, in Quebec, people has to bring there own food in a party, if you're a canadian person don't never do that in France, it would be so rude for the hostess. Indeed, it would mean that the food she cooks is bad....On the contrary, don't hesitate to compliment her for her reception, on front of all the guests.

      In my childhooddaly &quot;50s', my parents bought a television. No colours, the images were black and white, and only one or two cable channel.  I was looking at it with my parents. I found interesting some broadcasting reports. But it didn't take me away to read. My first steps about computer it was on my job; I had to use that device.  It was necessary to organise and manage the Social and Cultural Centre. It was only in the &quot;90s&quot; , that I started to use computer for my own life. The big gap arrived with internet; I was able to send email everywhere and after with skype to speak to my family. It was a big change for me because my family spread out in Asia and in France: before my letters arrived three weeks later and sometimes didn't arrive. Recently, I buy an iPad, and I start to read book on it. I just swipe with my fingers to go to the next page, isn't it magic?%% I use it on the plane and when I travel; no need to take many books in my suitcase and it's very easy to buy books by internet. Nowadays I also use smartphone, it's so small ; I can cary everywhere. It's a real huge difference; media communication becomes so easy. However I don't want to be addicted and sometimes I switch it off all when I don't want to be disturbed.

      The meeting today was quite tough and surprising. At the beginning the CEO was very disapointed about what he heard from his COO. He told him that the financial situation was not good, and the he probably should take big decision. He loves his employees as much as his company, and it is difficult for him to think about a possible downturn or merger with another company he doesn't like. But the CFO had great news about the latest report he got from his staff: the brand new product, the &quot;iMarvelous&quot; is a success, it seems that everybody wants to own one, so, in a short time the company won't be in a difficult position. We were all relived and the CEO schedule another meeting in a few day to check the sells and financial report. He also asked the COO to stay a while. I think we won't see the COO anymore !

      Living in a democratic country where born the human rights, gender differences slowly but surely try to disappeared. Our goverment encourages even urges to have parity in all the sectors. Genders' diversity  is a gift and brings a wide openning, male and females are thinking differently so the blending of ideas can be a great help. When we have parity in a firm, the company is more dynamic,powerful. Now one thing is not equal: wages! Why, we should not have the same salary for equal job! Why, discrimination of salary between male and female applying  for the same job. Having done and followed the same studies and cursus that unfair! This significant  point must be  redefined urgently. But we are on the good tracks,  the last decade has seen more and more women at the head of trusts and at the head of the board of directors.

He eschews human contact except for his friends to whom he saids that the world is complety wrong.

In which circumstance that  you think you are discriminated? 2. Which questions in the interview that you are asked for? Is there anything concern with  your domestic situation or matital status?3. With the same professional position, does everyone receive the same or unconsiderably diffrent salary? 4. Is there any unfavorable conduct or requirement  of the employee which is considered discriminating towards women rather than men in  work, like physical unwanted behaviours, comments, or unofficial working time, relocation requirement,...?In case she is intentionally dismissed:1.

The dismiss is announced long time before or recently without notice?4. Is there any explanation or excuses or financial compensating aid?

      Personally, I belong to the first generation which was born with the new technologies of information and communication, so I haven't really known a change. TV, cellphone, desktop, internet : I was born with all that kinds of media. Indeed, nowadays, desktop are rather old-fashioned; laptops and tablets are trendier but it's not a huge change. I mean, for example, last month I tidied the cellar up with my mother when I saw a sort of box, big as pocket book. I asked to my mother what it was and she tells me : &quot;oh! it's your father's walkman!&quot; This old walkman was like a prehistorical thing for me, but in fact it is the ancestor of the mp3. It's paradoxal because things have changed so fast that people with just 3 years of gap haven't had the same technological references. Then, I haven' known the cellphone, big as a &quot;phone cab&quot;. My first cellphone was a smartphone, it's a bit weird to imagine a cellphone without the camera application, an internet access, etc. I guess it's what we call the &quot;generational conflict&quot;, but I am aware of the luck I have to live with all this media and the issue in terms of security of private life that it can represent.%%

      Hello, Last year my husband and I we bought a house close to Paris. As you must know,  real estate prices are climbing. But because we got our second kids, it was urgent to move from our small flat. To realise our dream with this house we took a mortgage for 20 years. Now mostly 30% of our total income goes on our mortgage. Unfortunately also, the cost of living is continually going up and it's becoming more and more difficult for us to manage our finances. Maybe, we will have to stay in Paris either to take some summer holiday far away.

      Josh Woodward made here with 'Home improvement' a brand new style of song, regarding to his previous ones. Vocal, guitar and drums fit that smooth song. Despite of an uplifting rythm, the lyrics is quite sad and nostalgic. The story is about a man who lost his land and his work while the modern life has replaced his old lifestyle. Old struggle between roots and natural evolution of life ! Adapt or help yourself. This strange mix of sensitive lyrics and uplifting rythm is always pleasant. This will be a great hit, sure !

      Questions about corporate social responsibility are not easy to answer, it could depend on how you are involved in the company (working for that company or having an external point of view) and at which level (employee, part of the board or shareholder). For instance, if you are an employee, CSR sounds good for you cause you want that people have a good image of your company, so it could be transmit on you and they could have a good image of your job, a good image about you. On the other hand, if you are a shareholder, you are shared between two feelings : on the one hand you want to avoid to donate money, as a consequence you could have the most benefits you could expect but on the other hand the fact to donate money or services at local fundation or any similar kind of organization could bring to your company a free and appreciated publicity and as a consequence a good image and new customers.

When I regained consciousness all my friends were around me and were anxious. One my parent neighbour's came and she took me to the hospital. I had the arm broked and a lot of bruise.

      It's the first time I hear about Josh Woodward. I have to admit that I'm pleasantly surprised by his song &quot;Home improvement&quot;. I would say that the style of this song is a mixture of folk and rock. The guitar work rhythms the song nicely.The melody is quite simple but is really pleasant to hear. Josh Woodward has a nice voice with a good range. A part these musical considerations I find that the lyrics are interesting too. They denounce the permanent changes in the city made to improve people's lives, but which actually are the expression of the pointless consumer society.

      Dear Ian, I heard the news! No way! You can't leave your your job that way!

Have you ever consider the possibility to see a therapist? Even if you're not totally healed after a few session, you might see some improvements. You should give it a try! You can even try to find some compromises : like trying to use the bus unstead of the subway (I know it may be a bit longer, but this way you would'nt have to go underground) Anyway, I'm sure that if you try to explain the situation to our manager, he'd understand your situation and help you to find a solution with your wokspace ; why not a place with a window? I'm sure that with some natural light and fresh air you would be more confortable and less oppressed. Would you consider these options before taking your final decision? Kindly, Lyvia

      Nowadays management and colaboration are a huge part of the work. To work efficently, you company need a elaborate organisation. I will dwell on few ways required to manage a project. First and foremost, a project need an organisation and a leader. The leader will set up all the management. Without a leader, making a decision will need the entire group's acceptation, which will waste lot of time. Then, a teamwork need meeting. These meetings will not only be used to resolving problem but also dividing tasks between the employees. I advise you to schedule the next meeting in the end of each appointement. It set up a deadline. These meeting can also become a brainstorming. It is more efficient to think as a group than just one. Besides people need time to work alone on their tasks. That is why meetings have to be not too often. When people have so much meetings, they pay less attention in that and the meeting becomes inefficient. On the whole, to make a good teamwork, you need just two things. The first is a leader and the second is dividing correctly the time work between meeting and alone-work.

You can read a text at a red light. If you break the law you have to pay a fine but no way to increase the price of insurance. French people observes the rules because they protect the community but always criticizes and grumbles to keep free or to do what he wants. Furthermore we can't drive slowly. For this reason a new regulation has been announced to break the habit driving too fast. A lot of radar control are everywhere on the roadside and if you drive too fast you receive a strong fine on your boxletter. That's outrageous !

      Dear Sir or Madam,  I want to express you my displeasure about the Blue Cruise Alaska. Firstly, I chose this cruise for the comfort of vessel.

      Few months ago, I had presentation with two of my friends on a computing project. So, each of us had to write a part of the project.  I was in charge of the introduction and conclusion. When we took our exam, we realize that we done few mistakes. For my part, I thought that I could have spoken more slowy to draw audience's attention because I used to speak quickly. However, my opening was good, I expressed all the key points and the plan of the presentation. One My friend who was in charge of the charts had done a really good job. All the charts was interesting and whithout mistakes. Finally, the other friend who was in charge of the body of the presentation did a good job too but he was too serious and he also spoke too quickly. To conclude, we didn't do a perfect presentation but we did a quite successful prensentation.

      As a martial arts fan, I'm going to talk about a performing art that comes from my country, Parkour. Well, Parkour is essentially to go from one place to another, in the quickest and most efficient way possible by overcoming any obstacle you encounter, through the use of your own body. Parkour is looked at as a discipline, and even a lifestyle like martial arts. Basically, Parkour is the art of flight. It is the art of using effective and efficient jumps, climbing and swinging to conquer obstacles. The idea is, not to be controlled by your surroundings. It can be said Parkour has been around for ages, maybe since prehistory, when man figured out how to escape predators in the wild, by using his body and his environment to come out alive. David Belle is considered to be the founder of Parkour. I really like this discipline that I consider as a performing art, because it requires an outstanding physical condition, a lot of agility and flexibility.

      As a lot of country, some behaviours are very bad in public, people could be offended by that : picking your nose, spitting, slurping... For greeting you must know some little things : if it is someone who you don't know, you must shake hands each other. If you know a woman and if you are familiar enough with her, you can kiss her. If it is a familiar man, it depends on the professional social environment. In fashion or show business environment, men who know each other kiss each other. Moreover don't be surprised if men who have grown together or are relatives kiss each other. More, the number of kisses depend on the region. It is between one to four!

      i recently attebded a presebtation about our team procedures , I have to admire how calm the presenter was, Her voice is clear and strong. and she looked at people around the room instead just staring at her notes. Another thing she did well was to summarize her key point in the conclusion, I left the presentation remembering each important idea and her flow charts were compelling , One of them perfectly explained a procedure I have never really understood before . On the other hand one thing she could have done differently was to grab people's attention during the opening, I f she had given us an interesting face or figure for example I think some people would have felt more relaxed and motivated. finally I would have liked it if she have given more examples of payroll procedures. I'm not sure how to complete a time report. After all the presentation was really helpful and well prepared., I learned a lot , Thank you !

For the national market, it created a highest peak about quarter 1 2007, then began sharp decrease until now. The peak of international market appeared sooner the national market at the middle of 2005. Then it decreased to half of 1 m since 2007. The company has a very successful at the beginning in 2004. Especially in international market, it sharply increased until 2M after 3 quarters. The national market has a slower development, it had 1M after 1 years but the increased trend is longer than international market. This growing had lasted until 2007; it reached almost 3 M (higher than the peak of international market about 0.5 M). By the way of conclusion, we can see that the sales figure level for quite a long time for both international market( from beginning of 2007) and national market ( from the middle of 2007) so we can predict that the situation of the company get worse and worse if the leader wont have a changement in their policy

      Hi Natalie, I'm writing to tell you how was the CEO's opening yesterday. In the beginning, I believed the opening will have been interesting. Everybody was waiting it with impatience. His first words was very compelling everyone. I'ts right, he seemed very serious and motivated.  One good thing he did well was his charts. They were very clear, mostly the pie charts. Unfortunately, after some sentences, he removed the charts and we couldn't follow his strategy. Actually, we would have understood all his project if he had left the charts. It was getting confused. It's sure if a person had had the courage to ask him to put it, it would have been better. Also I would have thought he spoke in the microphone but he ( didn't or wouldn't ). In a result people behind me wasn't hearing him. However, he had thought to put some water on the table. Fortunately because it was very hot.

I also think that TV is a good way to relaxing after a hard day : my daughters and me love watching about Desperate House wife for example.  I just think that TV must be controle by the adults.

      I have never asked myself about the future, maybe except about my future. I can't say that I'm optimistic or pessimistic. I'm probably both, depending of how I watch people. If I consider current preoccupations with universal problems, I will be an optimist. Indeed, more and more people express their disagreement about conflicts or environmental damages or political abuses, etc. Unless people become more individualistic, we'll hope for a better world in the future. Minds have been getting more aware about these problems. But, is it realistic? I hope yes, but I'm not sure because we could say that there are more problems and fewer solutions. Today, I would like to say: &quot;Okay, everything's right in the future&quot; but I prefer to say: &quot;Wait and see what the future will be... and keep your fingers crossed!&quot;.

      In France TV program are so boring, unless to pay for cable TV. Films have already seen several times, reality shows are increasingly stupid. Series or sitcoms have already broadcast in cable TV many years ago. There are many good news and weather on TV. If you want to see sports or new film you have to pay for cable TV. It has a lot of great channels. On this, you also have a lot of entertainment program, for children but also for adults. To summarize, in France if you want to seen interesting things, you have to pay.

      I'm lucky because we don't have any financial problems. My husband and I have a good pension, we have no mortgage, our children have finished their studies and we have a very nice house. And now for the first time of our life we begin to have savings. But I'm worry for many people around me, the economic crisis have done many damages.  Some industries closed or just fired thousands of workers. There are a lot of unemployed people, it's difficult for them to pay electricity, rent and sometimes food. There is more and more homeless. Fortunately in France we have a good healthcare for everyone. I hope that things turned around soon.

      I love so much this song. Please listen to it and add it on your facebook!!! It's a good rock singer, he writes and sings lots of song which he have decided not to buy: they are free, you can download it legally and you can, only if you want , decide the price you want to pay for it. &quot;Home improvement&quot; is one of his best song, you're listening to it and you're travelling : it's so catchy!!! The melody and pace are rythmics. Josh's voice is pleasant. It's a song with a story, with an opinion and I think that it could be autobiographical too. So, I recommend this singer!

      The most of the part of successful persons should have specific traits and habits in the business world. On the one hand, they must be ambitious. So it means that they want to get a highly position in their job without losing their mind. On the other hand, they must possess qualities which could allow them to reach their goals. They're very proactive. They try to anticipate problems before they happen. No matter what happens, they never gives up. They are very persistent when faced with adversity. They have a great ability to find pragmatic solutions to problems. So they should be clever about their relationships with their subordinates. They have to use and to show them that they imagine the best ideas to develop the functioning of the company without asserting them. Like that, they could get success with others. The business world is tough. They have to be resilient ans innovative thinkers.

      During the last movies festable, I was very enjoyed by Iron Man which had been two Oscars for special effects and starring Oscar nominees Robert Downey Jr. It's a tipical science-fiction adventure with hight-tech, big screen and CGI along all the length.Iron Man is based on Marvel's legendary . The plot is quite simply : Robert Downey as Tony Sark is a playboy, genius head of Stark Industries. After he has captured an ambush, he used his intelligence for built weapon and hight-tech suit to escape. This dangerous plot was resolved by the new Iron Man.The super hero is commontopic, but the super hero theme is universal. Robert Downey Jr excels in his Stark's role, but when there are stunts, he's over-the top. Overall, it's amazing! Two trumbs up! Movie must see!

      Today the problem of organizations performance is the strategy. Having a good strategy is not the real problem, but executing it is the problem. Many organizations have strategies, but few can really execute them. I suggest to implement a good strategy plan and also a good executing plan. First of all, we have to define clearly where our organization is today. Its means that we have to do the SWOT analysis (strength, weakness, opportunities, threats) of the company. In addition, we have to develop a clearly and understandable mission statement, vision statement and core values of the company. Then we have to define where we want to be in the future. This part concerns the description of our goals: the strategic goals. These strategic goals will help us to create our own strategy map which is a very good communication tool for employees. Finally we have to track the achievement of these goals with the setting of KPI (key performance indicators). These KPI will tell us whether we are on the track or not.

      Dear Janice, I'm writing to tell you how terribly sorry I am for offending you. I do really apologize for Selma's behavior. Although I'm not looking to give excuses, I did want to explain my reasons for putting my foot in it. I've only known Selma for a few weeks and until now, she has never been impolite or rude. But I admit that she's only a classmate and we have never discussed money issues so far. I confess that I totally lacked judgment in this case. Obviously, I should have known better and I really should have been more careful with the people I bring at your house. I just wanted to be nice to her. I can assure you it won't ever happen again. Once again, please do accept my apologies and tell me how I can make it up to you. Kind regards,

      With regard to leadreship characteristics ,decisiveness is among the most important.A leader has to create an environment where a large number of people can communicate with each other openly , to work efficiently and effectively together toward a common ,clear formulated goal.Successful leadership includes pesuading others and earning trust..A good leader shares both vision and hardship ,he never underestimate himself his associates also.In terms of change , good leaders know that cirucumstances change,but human nature does not.And regarding failure ,it is not something to be feared-because mistakes make leader stronger.The ability to deal with unexpected cicumstances is sometimes the difference between success and failure.Effectively communicate the reasons for mistake to everyone involved is very important.If people of your team understand why mistake is coming ,they are less likely to care about the correction ,the positive change ,the optimisation...It's very important to develop sense of ownership ,create the enthusiasm in your team.

      I worked at Honeywell Technologies for several years. I learned a lot from that company. For instance I'd like to point out the fact that Honeywell is deeply involved in CSR. Along the years Honeywell demonstrated in many cases that it contributes to help poor people, support education programs of young students or also is able to create a specific fundation in charge to help people who have been impacted by severe climatic conditions such as hurricane, tsunami, earthquakes....I realized that Honeywell is a well-known company by its products and its quality of service but also because it is considered as a company costantly engaged in many volonteer works programs. For sure it is an excellent way to developp this company's image and keep in close touch with a diversified community all over the world. To give a clear and significant example of what Honeywell is able to do, its board decided several years ago to offer possibility to children of its employees to join Honeywell's academy. That program dedicated to young students from the age of 16 to 19, allows them to discover new scientific or engineering programs. We can think it is a win-win situation as those students with their excellent technical background will have later possibility to apply to some vacant positions at Honeywell.%% Serving local community is also a way how to better communicate on the company and creating futur talents of Honeywell.

These stage can help you to figure out what you really want to do ! The drawback of studying here is that it''s not common to spend a gap year like in England and you have to know what to study immediatly ... But obviously you can spend a year in an other country with erasmus which is very popular and very appreciated on your curricumum vitae !

      In France, There are many TV channels. Some of them are focus on &quot;news&quot;, &quot;movies&quot; , others show &quot;entertainment, reality show, top music&quot;, &quot;cartoons channel&quot; . So those programs depend on the directive line of each TV channel.  We also have a rate system described like: -10: not suitable for children under 10 years old,-12 not suitable for children under 12 years old, -16 not suitable for teenagers under 16 years, -18 for the adults because of sex.In my opinion there is violence on tv, we can see it in many cops series for instance &quot;the experts&quot;, vampirre diaries&quot;, etc...When you watch the news, desasters most of the time, people murdered, we are really scared. I strongly advocate for more educationnal tv and entertainment.

But a passer-by chased her and caught her by the hair. Somehow she managed to escape without her hair.The young woman was not a young woman at all, but a teenage boy. It is worrying to think that the couple has not been caught yet. He is now scared to leave the house. It was the most terrifying day of his life.

      Dear Robert, Thanks for your email. Here are the informations you ask me. - Why I want to study on line: It's more easy to schedule an online training than a traditionnal one. I won't be sticked in an unmovable classroom. I will be able to work from my home or travelling. I just need a computer and a normal internet connexion, and I still have the both. It could be cheaper than a traditional school and, even if there are still a lot of problems to solve, it could be more efficient. - Subjet I would like to study: General English, more the UK than the US one, but without exclusion of the latter. - What I hope to achieve with an online study program: I just want to improve my English skills, to have a better knowlegde of this langage and, even more, to get a better practice, to reach a higher level and to be able to undestand it, to speak it, to write it more easily than I'm doing now.

We took the local menu, with avocados and tomatoes they comes from a farm near the restaurant, for the main course we choose the T-Bone steak rare done, with carrots and green peas, my husband had also some baked potatoes. The meat was absolutely fabulous, and the vegetables were cooked just like we like. For the dessert, my husband had a cheesecake, he is totally found of this dessert, and I had a creme brulee. The waitress was very nice, and told us that we were great clients ! I didn't take coffee, but my husband had an espresso. We will surely recommand this perfect restaurant to our friends. We had a great time there.

      Hey Jeff, I also like this picture. Yes, Monkeys are very friendly. They love to play together and they are coming easily close to humans. Amy, I agree with you, monkeys are cute and smart. I think they can think and communicate together. In my opinion monkeys are very close to humans, they are as affectionnate as dogs. Monkeys are bigger than cats and smaller than lion. I think monkeys are wild animals but thay can easily became as a pet.

      Currently, the french TV has a poor quality about education,  smart program and real societal topic. I feel strongly that the quality it's degraded since 30 years. More we go forward more quality decreases. In my opinion, we should look back and fix with some old program such a Command Cousteau show which is more instructive than the reality show silly, Dorothe show which blended cartoon, game and education. We need to interrogate ourselves about what we want for children and teenager.

      I am 67 years old and I am now retired for 6 years. My career path ? It is very easy to summarize. I worked 40 years in the same bank. I got my master's degree in private law in 1970. The subsequent days, I began to work in a local bank. Why in this sector with a diploma of private law? Prior to the end of my studies, I was already married and had a child. Needs must when thr devil drives. Previously, during the University holidays, I had worked in banks, and the work pleased me. I thus accepted the offer made by a local bank. There, I occupied various managerial positions: branch manager, audit inspector, person in charge of credits to the private individuals,  to the professionnals ( shopkeepers, craftmen, small companies...). Afterwards, I developped the structure for the credits to associations and public authorities. Finally, I set up a structure for the short-term financing of the property developers and the property dealers. So, in my career path, there were some changes, but always inside the banking domain. Perhaps, my only regret  is not to have change straight my activity at a certain point. May be I should have been more ambitious.%%

Indeed, men earn nearly 10% more than a women for exactly the same job and assignments despite of the law!! Is it normal and fair ? No it isn't. We, woman have a lot of fights to make before to get the equality. Despite of the law, men are always thinking that we don't deserve the same salary even if we work more !! How hypocrit is it ! What an unfair fact ! We have to fight for our rights and to change minds and habits!

      I just listnened to the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune, and I think it's pretty catchy. I listened to it five times, and i can't get it out my head. Josh's voice is rough and edgy. He doesn't have much of a range, but he hits a few high notes. I was also a little confused. The mood of the song is kind of happy because of the quick, addictive beat. But I think that the lyrics are political, sad and sentimental. Very interesting ! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one song.

      Hi Ian,I know you are not well but your claustrophobia should not bind you to resign.Enclosed spaces are a source of panic for you and I could see your anxiety today when you were in the elevator to the 20th floor. You were sweating and shaking.I just want to tell you about Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. It's not easy for me to tell you that! But I have had a phobia: I couldn't take the plane and that was very embassing with my job and my clients in England.The therapy I followed was difficult, I had to talk of my fear, my past, my chilhood... It took about 12 calls with the therapist. But, you know what: last year I have made a bungee jumping, my fear of flight was away!You really need some help, don't be ashamed of your phobia, tell a therapist about it and you won't need any medication.I really trust in you.Friendly.Marie-Franoise

      Marseille is a nice city in summer but especially in spring. Winter is cold but not dry and autumn is cool. In spring you can go to the beach in the morning and in the afternoon because it's sunny and warm but never hot. You can swim in the warm sea. At night you can eat out in one restaurant of the port or watch some movies.

      A natural disater that struck me during my childhood, it's the tsunami in Southeast Asia in the aftermath of Christmas holidays on December 26, 2004. This tsunami was the result of the most violent earthquake in the world after Chile in 1960, has caused devasting tidal wave in the part of the Indian Ocean killing or missing more than 280 000 people. A death toll that exceeds what we know in the history of tsunamis and earthquakes. This is an underwater earthquake, whose epicenter was located off the island of Sumatra, which has led to surging tsunami of Indonesia to India, through Thailand, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. At 7 am (local time), there was an earthquake of magnitude 9 on the Richter scale causing a horizontal shift of 10-15 meters between the Indo-Australian and Eurasian tectonic plates. People have not been warned long enough, the number of dead and injured could have been less. Since this deadly tsunami, there was a flurry of activities by governments, international institutions and civil society for the creation of early warning systems for national and regional levels. Not less than 24 floating platforms advanced detection were placed in the Indian Ocean.%%

      Every year I live six months in Vietnam.Four years ago, I was in Hanoi with a friend, one evening we went to see the water puppet at the Thanh Long Theatre. A puppet show seemed to me a bit boring. That show surprised me, I have never saw a puppet show like this. The puppets appeared and danced over the waist-deep pool of water. It's magic, mysterious, unique. We don't see the puppeteers, we don't know how the puppets are moving. The puppeteers are behind the bamboo screen, the puppets are controlled from bellow. The puppets are supported by a large rod placed under the water. The puppets are made of carved wood and can weight up to 15 kilos. During all the show, a Vietnamese orchestra play traditional Vietnamese music, it's completely wonderful. Puppets dance on water is a tradition that dates from the 11th century, the stories are deeply rooted in rural tradition, originated around the Red River Delta, in the North. Now we can see puppets dance on water in different places in Vietnam. I hope you can see one day, it's amazing, stupendous.

      Actually, in my opinion there is no unique performing art in my country (France) even though some people might say cooking is one. So, I would like talking about an irish show that I saw a few month ago at Palace of Congress in Paris. I had a ticket for a place just in the middle of the first rank at two meters from the scene : I was immerged totally in that show. What I saw, what I heard was inspiring. Songs alternated with dances. Dances were so enthousiactic I would have liked to dance with the dancers. Songs in chord, in duet or by a singer alone were magical to my ears and the emotions they made me feel were so strong that, at a special moment, I really had my breath cut and, when I could breathe again, tears came to my eyes massively. I could't explain why it happened but, anyway, I was so happy !

      You will play in an area of 8x3 meters. You use 10 bottles with water inside. You line them up in lines of 4, then 3, then 2 and so on and so forth. The first player takes the frisbee and throw it. He can throw it two times on each turn. One pin knocked down is one added point. If all the pins fall, you can throw the frisbee two more times. The winner is the one with the most points. You can't play this game if there is too much wind.

      Is gender equality still a hot topic in France? You bet. There are many women in leading roles in business, art and politics. After the World War II , women should stay at home to take care about children and home. Men should work hard and bring money home. Nowadays , things are rather differents. I mean &quot;rather&quot; because now women work like men but they earn not the same salary. Tought they work a lot like men. That's why in France there still a little weird atmosphere about that problem because we have the feelings that this question never will resolve.

      Hello Michael I am really eager to let you know what happened this morning. I received a phone call from Lisa! You imagine how amazed I was! Why would she call me from Australia? But guess what! She was not in Australia but in town! I couldn't believe it. She gave me a rendez-vous, and I dashed to down town. I saw her in a caf : she was glowing! What are you doing here, I asked. She said she had got divorced two weeks ago, and she's back here for good. Isn't it great? and do you know what? I think she still loves me! Take care Marc

      Hi Bobby, I read your email with much attention and I am very surprised about your decision. Of course, I know you suffer a lot because your family has never been by your side to help and support you in your childhood. However, you will make a big mistake if you decide to continue shoplifting and other petty crimes! You had better not stay with your new &quot;friends&quot; because they will always have a bad influence on you. Furthermore, if you do not change your behavior now, you will likely to be arrested as an adult and the consequences will not be the same! The environment in jail is much more dangerous than in your juvenile detention, not sure you would be able to face with it as easily as in the past. So, I urge you to think twice before continuing in this way, even if you think it is the best solution for you. Moreover, do not hesitate to ask me if you are looking for an accomodation or help to persist in your schooling. Be sure I will do all I can to help you in this way, and I encourage you again to stop playing with fire, as long as it is still possible.%% Take care. Franck

      If you was a salesman, you can't forget your first big sale. I worked at Xerox since 2 months. I was a in touch with Orange, a big company specialized in telecommunications. They looked for a compact printer, fast, good quality printing and obviously cheaper! They needed of 150 units at 200$ each. Our preliminary offer was 250$ for each.That was very complicated, because the buyer was not flexible. He always told me that Canon or HP could offer him best prices with big discounts. I checked my boss and he didn't get a solution too. One fine day, I read in a famous magazine, that the Xerox 6015 was the more dependable printer in this category. Suddenly, I was wondering, if the Xerox 6015 was really the more dependable, it means that this printer seldom break down. So, the risk was low if I put a contract for free. I did that and the buyer and we were in agreement. Finally, we found an agreement for 170 units at 250$ each and a free contract including parts and labor.

      In the south of France, their isn't any skyscraper. I am living in Nice where all the buildings are not small. However, you will find a lot of interesting kind of architectures. The most famous part of Nice is the Old City who was one century ago part of Italy. In this area, you'll find old buildings. You'll also find a lot of churches. In an other part of Nice, you can visit the Russian Church who is the most unusual architecture I ever saw. A lot of Russian bought houses and settled down in the French Riviera. The weather is warmest, the people are more friendly and although they wanted to live in a free country. They built the Russian Church who is really colorful. Outside, she has a lot of colors such red, yellow, green, silver and white. She is a masterpiece of architecture. I'd like to say that I don't really like these race for the sky and I feel oppressed when I'm standing near of a tall building like in New York City. I enjoy to live in a less modern area where people have &quot;their foot on the ground&quot;.

The ambiance with my colleagues is pretty casual and natural. We go out together once a week, give or take. We work approximately 25 hours a week. So, we have a very good work-life balance. The only drawback of my job is the relation with the hierarchy. They have no idea of the meaning of pedagogy, they just care about money and benefits. However, the best point of my job it's holidays. People think Chinese people dont have a lot of holidays, but that's not true for students and teachers. We have around 15 weeks a year! I love my job!

The violent movies are announced before their beginning and there is a mark on the bottom of the screen TV to remind that the program is not suitable for a certain age. I am amazed at sex on the music video, kids cannot watch channel music.

      I just listened to the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. It's a king of country music song. the rythm is very quickly and it doesn't change during the song. Because of this, I think it's an annoying song. The singer has a pretty voice, but he hits always high notes, never the low notes, so the song stays annoying. The tune don't get in my head because it's boring and it doesn't give me a good feeling. For me, a song must have cut of rythmes, surprising parts, a part of mystery.  All is predictive! I don't recommend this song, because better songs exist!

      I feel strongly that my country has a good rating concerning television. For example, for each program, we have a little logo appearing on the left corner on the TV. So each logo matches to a precise age bracket. Indeed, we have programs forbidden to less of 10, to less of 12, to less of 16 and to less of 18. These two last category matches to programs with a lot of sex or violence. In my opinion, it help people, and particularly those who have children, to choose their programs. Howerver, and generally, I think that parents should be careful when they watch TV with their children, because some scenes could be not shoking for them, but very shoking for their children.

      Last month I went to a presentation about OpenStack, an IT virtualization technology. I must tell that I was very impressed by the organisation. There were many presentations, many presenter, with their own styles. Some were like a fish in water, others were really stressed, but all of them were very professional. We knew that they all mastered their subjects. I could notice that they all had the same way to summarize their key points. Their slides were coherent, and charts helped me to understand and remember important ideas. On the other hand, one thing they could do better was how they managed time. Some presentations were too long, others werent enough. Presenters were stuck on their computer, instead of moving and watching us, which caused the presentation to be boring, at the end. There were a lack of examples as well, which would have been useful in order to grab the public attention. Overall, all of those presentations helped me to understand what was OpenStack, so mission accomplished.

The first time it's not a problem because, they were far to me and I can accross with facility but after fews minutes to fishing I would move to the position but the cowns is around to me. In the past i'm a little boy and I'm very impressed by this big animals. I think, they just got a food but me I don't know whose I can do.

      The area is about 8 meters x by 3 meters . Use 10 plastics bottles. Line up bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Gave a frisbee. Take onty Two shots on each turn. Gave a total of 10 turns for each player Score one point for each pin that is knocked down. If a strike is scored (all the bottles are knocked down), then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together. The winner is the player with the most points

      Sorry for this answer but it's impossible to read the electronic paper on the left, I asked about that. I don't know what you want, so I wrote a story.A amerindian friend and I have been to Hudson bay in the great north of canada for hunting the caribou the last winter. We needed two and half days to join the camp base with a 4x4 and 2 Skidoos on a trailer.Every day wake up at five o'clock, take a shower then a big breakfast, packaging the Skidoo and go to find caribou.The fourth day we were very far away from the camp base when I killed my last caribou and it was the sunset. We have been driving for five hours to return. When we arrived a team was ready to leave and try to find us.After a big story to explain all the day we drank some beers. It was a funny day.James

She went into The Coffee Pot, and came out carrying coffee, a laptop and a handbag over his shoulder. Then when she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth she saw a young couple get out of a car. They suddenly began vandalism the local newsagent. Meg decided to go over to them like a good citizen but the girl pushed a gun into her stomach, she grabbed the laptop of her and ran off down the street. In finally, a passer-by chased her and caught her by ther hair at which point it came off in his hands. It was a wig! And the young woman was a teenage boy!! Surprising, isn't it?

Is there any discrimination more illegal than an other one or are there on the same level ? What would be your reaction if you'd known that a member of your family has been a victim of discrimination ? When did you ear the first evidence of discrimination in your environment ? How this event had been solved by this victim ? Could you tell me a bit more about this person ? (Marital status, gender, age, origin, social class, job...?) Where this event occured ?

I have had several mission in banking, and financial sector. In fact i had no time to think about my futur. All was going so fast. Employees came looking for me. Following each interviews, I had a serious proposal. Suddently I felt the economic crisis in the computer bubble. The demand fell drastically and the salaries weren't the same that it was. Now I feel that I missed something and I have more and more difficulty to find missions. I need to improve my skill and I think I have to take training corresponding to the market. Then I have to retire myself one year. After that I hope find a good job in a big bank. The economic situation will certainly be better in the next two years.

      Some fathers spend all their time in their work. At every time they can explain that they have good reasons to work more and more: to earn enough money  to offer the best college, the best clothes, the best activities to their children. They think that they are good father but it is not right. Children need their parents to grow up. As a father I learned that you are responsible of the education of your children. It is not the job of school it is yours. You have to spend time with them even if you are tired and you just want to sit on your sofa and watch TV. You have to play with them, you have to explain them what is important. To be present is the key. Your task is to show them how to be dynamic, open-minded, polyvalent and responsible.

      In my view, nobody wants to break the rules or go against the law, but it's difficult for some people in my country. We have a new law that doesn't allow smoking in any restaurants or bars. Honestly, I don't smoke, but I can understand why it's tough. To my mind, people are used to smoking in bars and restaurants. Now, if they do it, it's committing a crime. They have to pay a fine. Some people are too addicted to not smoke. It's like they need it, but they can't smoke. I know they can go outside but, if you ask me, that kind of ruins the feeling of being with friends. On the other hand, people who don't smoke are happy that the air is cleaner in bars and restaurants. I have friends who smoke and friends who don't. They ask me if I'm in favor of the new law or against it. From a political point of view, I'm sure it's the right thing. But personally, I just don't know.

      I make recently a presentation about &quot;Mental health implications of music&quot; for a national meeting. For introducing the subject, I summarized  the results of neuroscientific and clinical studies of music over the past two decades. I presented a briefly review current literature. The goal of my presentation was to related the effect of music,  to increase substantially our understanding of its use as a means of therapy. For give any examples, I passed several slides and three movies,  with the results of clinical studies. My conclusion has been to provide some evidence that music therapy can be used as an alternative therapy in treating depression, autism, schizophrenia, and dementia, as well as problems of agitation, anxiety, sleeplessness. I think my negative point had to don't utilise the more music examples, but the time for this conference has been limited. In a big meeting room, I utilised my voice clear and strong for captivated my public.  My agreeable surprise was to hear the chairman invited me  to speak on the same subject next year!

      I recently went to the new COO's presentation. I think he is a really good speaker, really. In fact, he emphasized well the key points, he made pauses at the right moments, and was clearly sure of what he said. I must admit that it would have been better if he'd have insert more visual aids: we only saw one bar graph, which is not enough I think... I would have insert a pie chart to show our market share. However, it was really interesting, for example concerning the future team-building project, which is a great idea from what I think. One last bad point is that the speaker didn't talk loud enough, sometimes I couldn't hear what he was saying, and that's really a shame! I will soon recommend him to speak more clearly and with a microphone, of course, but he was globally brilliant!

      A demanding, but hectic life. I'm married and got eight children. To deal with multiple children is like managing an unruly mob. When you are dressing one, there is another one upsetting dishes in the kitchen. While running to that child you hear screams from the bedroom as the other two of your kids start a fight. It is my lifestyle and I don't let work influence my decision to have a big family. How to handle it ? It's just a question of organization. Older children are great for doing chores and helping to entertain the youngers . Even children as young as three can prove to be great helpers if given the chance. You have to treat them individually instead of treating them as a group. Be patient and calm and be fair when dealing with all the children. However, it's normal to stop sometimes and children arent the only ones who require personal time; adults need an hour or two here and there alone as well. Life can be hard but I'm not giving up. What my wife and I have realized is that we do not want another life.

      In my country,women and men roles are both same and different Same because the majority of women work out of their home Different because when they get back from work,they start a second working day,that to say the home work:looking after children,housework etc.. On the other hand,as in UK  their average is lower than men for the same work . In despite of the fact girls studdy better than boys at school and at the university,men get better jobs than them. They stop working when they have babies for several mmonths or years and look after children when they are ill Should home work be feminin tasks? Should women be considred as exclusively be able to look after children in case of illness? Is men'swork more important than women's?

      Name of company - Blue Cruise Alaska It was the awful travel of my life! Also, I write to the customer service because, I'm really angry about this cruise! First the vessel wasn't new and it wasn't a cruise ship. In fact, it was a horrible and a shabby little boat. For example the ship had many problems with its engine during the trip. Our vessel was very dangerous! Then, the cabin was dirty and full of ants; beds were uncomfortable; bathrooms were dirty and disgusting. Next our captain was unfriendly and unprofessional; he woke up late. Yes I know, its difficult to see wild animal but we see only type of the animals they were promised In the end, there were extra, hidden charges. To summarize, this is not the holiday package that I paid for!

      Dear Dean Righter,  Thank you for considering me for your online study program. Please find my reponse to your request below. Why I want to study online. I am currently working full time. So I did not have time to go to traditional courses. Online courses allow me to work when I have free time and especially on weekends.  Subject I would like to study I would like to take  English online courses that you offer. In my work, English is essential. I especially would like to improve in the conversation, this is really my weak point.  What I hope to achieve with an online study program I want to advance in my career. To get a promotion, I need to speak English fluently. However, learning English is not just for work-related reasons. When I'm on vacation in a foreign country, I'd like to talk more easily with people.  Sincerely,

      A prior remark : all properties are fulfilling the location requirement : in Ionian and close to the seaside.1) This cottage wouldn't fit the expectations because it doesn't contain enough bedrooms : only one.2) The Hamilton house has 5 bedrooms but needs a complete restoration. It is a big historical abode that offers a beautiful landscape over the bay.3) This building would not be convenient too because the larger apartment includes only 2 bedrooms.4) This villa perhaps could match the Blight family needs in terms of capacity but we should investigate to know the number of bedrooms it can propose. The problem is that it is only available for investment as a holiday rental business.To summarize, i think the best choice for the Blight family would be the option 2 as money is no object and they are opened to do labour for love.

You even haven't to go to the library, you can find all you need on line, and directly send your works to the teachers.

      France is a wonderful and various country, visited by lots of tourists particularly Paris. I will give you some pointers : - Offer a gifts if you are invited : bottle of vine, a box of chocolates, some flowers ... - It's not required to leave a tip, you can do it if you enjoyed your meal. - In a restaurant, it's better to eat when everybody in your table have their food. I don't know all the correct etiquettes. But I think, the easier way to learn them is to observe people and ask them if you aren't sure. The most important thing is to be polite.

      I remember when the last big tsunami was announced in 2004, I think. I was terrified in front of images from the news. I saw all these houses destroyed covered of mud. How don't wonder if there weren't people under these fragments. There were more or less two hundred thousand deads in south asia. The living people remaining  were rescued by the rescue workers of different countries. After this day, there were a lot of application for donation. This was a great success to help them. The nature is beautiful, but also very dangerous. Although it exists a different system to warm against the tsunami.

      It was by a dark night, as dark as the grave he now is, that Robert Cox, the eighty years old man who founded the powerful Cox Oil company , was found dead in his own house. His mansion, to be more precise. He got stabbed right in the heart with his own jewel-encrusted dagger. At first, everyone thought he was killed by his older son, Patrick. They had a fight a few day ago about the company because Robert was still the chief executive officer and, according to Patrick, he was taking really bad decisions. So, Patrick was suspected and has he had no alibi this evening, he went to a trial for this crime. But wait, you haven't heard the end. After a few days, a detective found that Robert Cox became bankrupt and that the company was going into liquidation. And Robert was the only one to know about that. Finally, Patrick was judged innoncent. But he inherited a lot of debts!

      In France, like in numerous other countries, the punishment for a crime is linked with the &quot;degree&quot; of the crime. A thing which is criticised around here is that perpetuity  doesn't really exist, like in the USA, where you can be convicted for more years of prison than your entire lifetime (and that is also kind of ridiculous - why just don't say people are convicted until their death instead of 150 years, for instance ?) Well, I said that perpetuity doesn't exist in France : that's true. The french &quot;perpetuity&quot; is &quot;just&quot; thirty years, at the maximum. This is called a &quot;safety sentence&quot;. I don't know very much the French system -even if I'm french-, but I guess some people are in jail for their entire lifetime. The problem is : some dangerous killers are released after thirty years, and even if prison changes a man -in better or worse-, only God knows what he is up to when he goes back to the outside...

      Hi Alan, If you want to study sciences in France, you need to know that degrees are specifics. Engineering schools are similar to MS universities but with some differences. There is several ways to join them. By the college with a bachelor of science (french name is a &quot;Licence&quot;). Or by other class witch are french specific and are named &quot;preparatory classes&quot;. At the end of these classes you need to have an exam and your ranking will allowed you to chose one or other school. So it's a real competition between students to be the best. Hope this help !

      Down by the river It was Inspector Mike Clint's day off and as usual, early in the morning, when the city was still quiet, he enjoyed going down for a walk to buy cigarettes or the newspaper. Even tough the sun had just risen, he could easily tell it would be another scorching day in Jackson, Mississippi. Clint was strolling down Main Street when his attention was drawn to the newspapers. They all read the same headline : &quot;Oil tycoon James Tyler found dead&quot;. The article mentioned the 90-year-old-magnat had been found bleeding to death in the lobby of his luxurious mansion in Jackson by his gardener, Joseph Conty, who had been working there for 40 years. Clint jumped into his old chevrolet and hurried to his office. Joseph was being interrogated by his colleagues. The old man had been killed with a sharp object such as a knife or a huge scissor, both of which could be found in the Black employee's toolbox. Clint knew Joseph, a kind, honest, trustworthy man...but he also knew how White justice worked in the Deep South. Racial tensions were like embers on a fire, ready to spark off with the slightest breeze. Especially since the murder of MLK a few months earlier. His colleagues were talking Joseph into confessing his crime, that he had killed Tyler to steal him 500 dollars before calling 911. Clint took over and quickly pointed out some inconsistencies in his colleagues' report. Why did County receive a phone call on that very night, urging him to go into Tyler's mansion? Who called him ? Someone surely needed him to be there. One of his scissors had been missing for a few days. Who took the possible murder weapon? How come County found 500 dollars in his toolbox? The employee was devastated by his boss' death. Clint investigated the magnificent two-story-house, with an impressive entrance staircase and noticed a few missing objects on the wall of the luxuriously decorated interior. He went on to question Tyler's close employees. John Reif, Tyler's so-called right hand man, watched Clint stepping out of his car, took an emeraud incrusted dagger out of his bag, looked at the blade stained with blood,an evil smile on his face and put it carefully in a locked drawer... There was a knock at the door. -&quot;Come in, Inspector&quot; NB : I'm sorry, I know I didn't respect the number of words but I don't understand how it's possible to write a murder essay with 150 words... Maybe I didn't quite understand what was meant by the term &quot;entry&quot;. I look forward to reading to your answer. Will I be able to start again ? Thanks for your help.

It is not that he is a bad singer but over time, I was more and more the impression that he was crying and that was very annoying.

      Last night, I ate with my sister and a friend at a japonese restaurant called Zengmaya. We often go there. So we don't need to make a reservation and the employee always find a nice table for us. As usually, the dining room was softly lit and the music very relaxing. There, the place look beautiful, too, with nice japonese paintings and items. The food is not organic but it's always fresh and well-cooked. I ordered vegetarian californian makis and a blend of sashimis. It was served with a soup and a bowl of rice. I had a jasmine tea too. It was delicious. We really enjoyed our dinner.

      hi, In France, the education system was actually trend to use new technology. For example, in more classes, the teacher show the content courses directly in big screen. You always receive this content by mail fewer hour before the courses. And after the courses you can receive the notes and the solutions of many exercices. By the way, it's not unusually to pass exams totaly online. I'm all about all this technology who the university give us. Otherwise, just be careful because of the cheating.

Actually, rules and law regarding health and securtiy are made both to protect citizen and ensure its security. Furthermore, in each location, it's mandatroy to display the specific procedure of security and the laws to apply in case of non-compliance. But, what about the change management.

      I'm a specialist of play, games and toys. Prior to that current job I worked in a library, following my french litterature degree. After 4 years as a librarian,  I decided to resign for travelling in Africa. Subsequently, I became a french teacher of secundary schools in several countries. I lived in Africa for 5 years while I did research about traditional games. I spent all my leisure time on visiting villages and families to take picture of games and ask for exact rules. When I came back to France, my knowledge in traditional toys and games was very important. Consequently, one more time, I changed my job to take up teaching play and games. Little by little I improved my expertise. Finally, 6 years ago, I have been creating the first European Educationnal Training Center of play and games.  For the future I'd like to continue with the same topic on which I'm so passionate.

      I listened more times the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. It's a folk-rock tune , and the first time i have listened , i found it pretty catchy .However i can't get her out my head it's a wonderful music . Josh's voice is very rough and edgy but his voice is suitable with this style of music. He doesn't have much of range .The mood of the song is kind of self-confidence and happiness but also sadness because of the speed and variation of the addictive beat .I think that lyrics are political sad and sentimental .Very amazing ! I recommend this music when you want a beat and some politics in one music.

      In my country we can notice two types of Universities: private and public. These two types have the same main goal: to educate students. Except their goals we can notice only another one similarity, they use sometimes the same teachers. These two points are all they have in common. In general the number of students in public universities is bigger than the one in private university, therefore we have a very wide campus in public universities. Unfortunately public universities have not enough resources to manage all these students. Beside the education in public universities is very tough, to succeed in these universities the students have to do a lot of work. By comparison, private universities give a better education due to his little number of students and to his bigger resources. In fact private universities are more expensive and they have good material to help students to succeed. We can find in it many libraries, many computer rooms and teachers are always availables.

      I would like to lodge a claim about a travel company &quot;Blue Cruise Alaska&quot;. During our trip we found a lot of problems on the ship: the cabin was dirty and full of ants, the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom was disgusting. It was not cruise boat, but a shabby little ship which had the problems with engine. In spite of the company proposed all exclusive in their ad, we had extra charges to pay. Waiting forward for your answer. Yours..

      My view about the future is uncertain. In fact i'm pessimistic and optimistic at the same time. First of all, i'm a little bit pessimistic because of people who waste the world, particularly rich countries and their fewer laws about environment. However, i would like to be optimistic. In fact, they are a lot of opportunities in developping countries like Africa. Finally, i really don't know about the future but i prefer predict an optimistic vision of the world.

      It happened the last january in a small town in Australia,called Shepparton. I worked in a fruitpicking everyday under 40'c. I hated because I dindn't love work with someone I didn't appreciate so much. Why I didn't appreciate that situation? Because it was a kind of person who everyday complains. And few days later , I talked about my situation to a friend when we went under an individual shower and speak loud to hear what we saying. Then, I said &quot; I hate work with Benjamin.He is so lazy , lunatic and he doesn't want to work and earn money together. I want to change my colleague&quot;.Suddenly, I heard a far voice says &quot; Is up to you to change the team if you don't like me&quot;.It was Benjamin.What awkard! Now, I try to pay attention when I speaking on an other person.

      In order to identify the demografic group in which we shoud expand, I am going to compare them. The first group is composed by women aged between 15 and 19 years old, 29% of them purchase at least one magazine a month. In contrast, the second group (18 to 24 years old men), read more (47% purchase at least one magazine a month) but however they generally prefer magazines supported by an extensive website content. In addition, the competition is stronger in the first group (twice more competitors!). Furthermore, the purchasing power of the second group is quite high ($242 billons, that is 60% more than the one of first group). With these facts, it could be an easy decision to make, but the future trends show important adicional information. In the year 2025, the purchasing power and the demographic size of the first group will have increased dramatically. In opposition, the purchasing power of the second group will have increased steadily, and the democraphic size will have fall dramatically.

      In my opinion, nowdays there are more violent programs on tv. Every day, we can see on some channels, more and more violent movies. Even if there is a rating system, i think it's quite difficult to respect that for childrens. Because we are not there always.  There also are too many commercials on TV, every 15 or 20 minutes programs stop to show commercials; some are so funny, but others are boring or incomprehensible. We need to ask for more restrictions, educational programs.

      Hi Renee, I have just received the survey and I don't agree with everything. The first point is I'm not really sure that a connexion between our education and how long one spends watching TV exist. Actually, I made higher education at the university and I'm a worker's son. After, I agree totally with my age group, I love to watch movies and i have got seventy Blue Rays on my video library. When I start to watch an action movie, I can't stop watching it because I am concentrated on the movie, I come in an another world.

It's not really a low fat food, but you can also have a healthy food. You just have to go to Union Squarre. There is a little market with local producers and organic products. On this place you can go to &quot;the whole food&quot; where as they say you can find all kinds of food.

Together with the school principal I already discussed first steps to support poorer student, to renovate school rooms and to improve the cafeteria performance.

      It's awesome having Alan as my work colleague. He's so enthusiastic about his job. He really shows his commitment to the company. Moreover, he is often very aggressive when he wants something. When Alan is trying to negotiate a deal, he's usually very accommodating. He tries to make sure everyone gets some of their objectives or goals met. Most people like working with him because of that. But Alan is a little shy sometimes and doesn't handle forceful individuals too confidently. Sometimes, he is being stubborn as a mule ! It's hard to find a compromise when he feels he is right. Then, Alan makes some many mistakes on his making sales because he doesn't listen to the needs of their clients. He really messed it up. Before he takes on any more responsabilities, it would be a good idea to think about how he is going to improve his weaknesses.

      In my country, Brazil, the school system is different from US. Generally the students go to school only a few hours a day. There are two sessions one in the morning and other in the afternoon. But the grade it's similar from US. If you are at college you can choose also night courses. Usually people who works during the day chose the night courses. It's not unusual for wealthy people to go to public university. They have the best teachers and courses. It's unfair for the most part of population who needs to pay a lot of money for study. I'm in favor to public school for all the people.

      I decided to learn English when I became aware that it was tremendously important for business and travel. So, since a few years, I tried to study English by myself but It was difficult for me to be self-motivated. Plus, I had no opportunities to talk with others English speaking people. Fortunately, last year one friend of mine recommended me to enrol in online language training like Englishtown. According to him, this online platform was going to allow me to improve my English skills more easily and more efficiently. At first, I didn't believe him. But, finally I dared to overcome my misgivings. It has been convenient for me to follow my courses whenever I have wanted and from anywhere. Now, I realize that English has improved my life by allowing me to meet other English speakers from all over the world and communicate with them. Even though the learning process has frequently been frustrating and painful, I'm proud of the progress I've made.

      The first time I met my best friend was 30 years ago. We both went to a military school when we were 17 years old.I remember this first day when we met. We were in our collective room and he looked very shy. He looked a little sad, probably because he just left his parents. I have to admit I was probably in the same condition like him.  I went to him to launch a discussion. Then we started to talk about our respective lives, families. And after 30 years we are still talking together. He got married. I did too. They have kids. We do too. It's good to consider that after many years we are still friends.

      To Blue Cruise Alaska, I'm writing to you to make a complaint about your cruises and your advert. I have made a cruise with your company and it wasn't what you expected. First, the rooms where not comfortable, they were dirty and disgusting. Then, the captain was unfriendly and always late. We had an engine problem and we have waited for a day to be repair. Concerning the animals we only saw eagles and no over as describe on your advert. Finally, We have had a lot of extra charges for a packing travel. I hope that you will consider my letter to make changes on your boat. Kind Regards

      Dear Janice, I'm writing this letter to say how much I am embarrassed about my last visit with my friend Selma. I would like to explain to you my genuine apologies from her part and from myself. I really the feelings that I betrayed your kind welcome in your house, so I completely understand which this awkward situation upsetting you. It was utterly rude and displaced from Selma to ask you all the time the price of everything. However you have to understand that Selma come from an another culture. Incidentally, in Russia they used to express their interest about money to an otherwise way. However, I admit that Selma was beneath my responsability and I must concede my own mistake about it. Therefor, from myself I promise that no one will never give you any trouble in the future. Yours faithfully. Christophe Copin.

      I've been reading in the latest newspapers that they have really seperated for several months and theyre getting a divorce. His wife Alana would have readen some suspicious sms from a supposed escort girl on his mobile and after asking him about it, she moved out. All rumors said that Gavin has been cheating with a lot of escort girls, actresses or top models. It sounds like a conspiracy about his love stories and his marital life! However, the tabloid love the scandals and they haven't shown a lot of evidence that he has been unfaithful.

So many people were killed and the others were hospitalized. I can't imagine what those poor people have lived. International Organisations were helped at a fundraiser.

      I think in France, we have no quite help for educations orientation. A lot of students are lost after high school diploma. They don't know whatever they to do want. And sometimes they continue their studies but without career goals. So I'm all for that students take a gap year after their diploma. But it's more and more usuel to take a gap year to make a trip between the fourth and fifth year of studies. This solution have a dsavantage : it can cost a lot...However, a gap year can have a obvious advantage of student's determination and plans.

      If you want create a successful project, there aren't miraculous recipes. Nevertheless, you have better to respect a few rules and to show common sense. First of all, you absolutely must carry out an accurate and in-depth analysis of your needs and to be aware of the kind of skills which are required. That's a first stable step, where making an error is forbidden. After that, try to incorporate individuals who will be able to get along and to collaborate with others, because a teamwork is like a soccer team. Individual skills don't form an efficient team: A good team spirit is the paramount key to success. Plus, you need a leader who heads the team, like a captain, and makes them to be willing to make a commitment to the project. That being said, you must never forget that, in order to be creative, colleagues have to be allowed to freely propose their ideas, with the guarantee that they will not be dismissed. They need to know that they have room for error! Many important discoveries stemmed from an error: Never forget that! After all, regular meetings will enable to coordinate proposals and to make decisions.%%

      In my country, there are yet many things to do to improve the gender equality. For instance in 2013, women earn less 24,5 pourcent than men. Then, in politic only 26,9 pourcent of women are menbers of the Assemble nationale in 2011 and 34,9 pourcent are menbers of The European Parliament in 2009. However, men are not equal to women about custody of children, 72,1 pourcent of women after a divorce have custody of the children. To conculde,  many effort permited to improve gender equality and we will need many effort to improve it until finally having a real equality .

      Dir Sir, I would like to buy the flat I am currently living in and I am writing about the possibility to request a loan. Indeed I think there are many advantages, the most important is that it will be cheaper to buy than to rent in the long run. The property builds equity and in my opinion this is very important for the sense of stability. Moreover, this is a good way not to be dependent on a landlord, and to be free to change decor for example. My finances should allow me to buy the flat because I have an adequate income to pay the mortgage payments. You can also see in my budget outline that I have actually a rent which is probably the same amount as my future mortgage payments. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information. Yours sincerely.

      I've just listened the song of Josh Woodward called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. I didn't know this singer, he has a great voice, a little rough, like a crooner. But not a jazzy crooner, much more a folk singer. The song is edgy and catchy thanks to its fast beat. I've already began to dance on it in my room ! The melody doesn't really change and you can hardly differentiate the verses from the chorus, but with his acoustic guitar, Josh Woodward plays a sweet and sentimental song. You can listen to &quot;Home Improvement&quot; to wake up in the morning, before going to work and be sure having a good day! Enjoy it !

      &quot;homme improvement&quot; by Josh woodward is a really great song I really love that kind of melody and the rythm is so catchy (it reminds me the one of the song &quot;born to be wild&quot; but more soft) I' m totally addicted, it's inked in my head. This song makes me think about joy and happiness. the singer is quite good but doesn't really hit high notes. In all case, the mixture of these three points creates kind of a pleasant osmosis for my ears, even if the lyrics are sometimes a little sad and ennoying..... Whatever, otherwise, I recommend this music without hesitations.

      In my opinion, television in France is quite around sex, couple, teens and reality shows. For example, reality shows or scripted reality inspired by American one, with young boys and young girls without any talents and any sense of intelligence in a big house. That's bullshit, shameful and degrading. First they fall in love for bad reasons, second they have sexual relationship face viewers, and at last, they realize their bad reasons to fall in love with the wrong person. I feel strongly that it is a very bad exemple for teenagers and even for young adults. They just have to know that we accept the love we think we disserve. Therefore, kids you have to think that you desserve better ! (good slogan isn't it)

      Dear Brother I guess you think I am quite happy with my job as an engineer in that big Civil Works Company. And in fact I was, as long as all my activity was working on sites in far countries. I liked to travel and discover new countries and new people. That was the good time. Unfortunately, the Company has changed their policy, and for two years now, I have been enclosed in an office in London, and honestly I hate that. Listen to this. I have decided to change my life. I resigned yesterday and I will leave UK in a month. I will own my own business in Kenya, and run a lodge at the border of a wildlife park. Isn't it exciting ? Brother, if your office job is getting boring, why wouldn't you join me there ? Love Your brother

      For the future I am optimisitc. But It's not easy for success her life.  We must work very hard and we must do a lot of sacrifice on the life family. We must be carrefull at the environment and the world resource (water, nature, energy).The are also a lot of people pessimistic. They are afraid for the planet, and the environment. It's true that we are in the world comumption. There is not good for the world. There are a lot of excess. For example we are repair the cellular, rather than buy other at the fist break down.

      Josh Woodward, Home Improvement Drumms, electric guitar and singer. Josh Woodward, famous singer and songwriter, give us a different style in this song, less dark than in the oldest albums. This is an enjoyable song, with a sad history and a lively rhythm, helped by a pleasant guitar work. It's a pleasant and light pop sound. Definitely a great melody with lyrics about the America's consumer society. The fans love this new song and appreciate it even if the lyrics are not happy. To conclude, this melancholic song makes us thinking about our life, and how the things changed,and are going to change, not always towards the good direction. I recommand you to buy it!

       One new law has been taken by our government a few years ago concerning the amount of deposit when a person contracts a lease. Since the implementation of this new law, the management cannot ask a deposit that represents more than one month rent. The French government decided to set up this law, since future tenants were usually asked to let a deposit that represents three months of rent. However, a lot of persons were not able to pay such a deposit and they didnt have any access to accommodation. Only persons with a good salary were able to pay a such amount. From a social point of view, I can understand that accommodation is a right for everybody and if management ask for three months rent as a deposit, a lot of persons will not be able to pay and in consequence, the lease will be refused to them. On the other hand, one month rent is very few as a deposit since currently, a lot of persons who leave their accommodation let it in a very bad way and sometimes, the owner has to do a lot of wroks before finding a new tenant.

      Paris is a town steeped in history.The city is well-known for its marvelously preserved historic architecture.Paris is a most tourist-visited city  in the world. In my opinion ,the cause of this success is maintain of balance between modern and historic arcitecture.For example ,the modern very busy district La Defense is relatively separate of historic center. At the same time there is a system of modern and effective public transport.The Parisian museums The Louvre and Orsay are well-known collections ,it houses as ancient as contemporary sculpture and painting.Paris is a very green city ,there are a lot of picturesque gardens and beautiful parcs here.The most famous is Jardin de Tuileries ,near the Louvre museum and Jardin de Luxembourg.I would like to recommend You to visit The Notre-Dame cathedral ,situated on Cit island.

      In France, everything depends on the relationship you have built. For instance, when you share the bill in a restaurant, Americans always go into detail, so everyone pays exactly for what he had. The French do not like this and consider it the sign of sheer miserliness: if you divide by the number of guests, some will get more, some less : there will be a link between them. Another typically behaviour is French galanterie which is not machism: if you are a woman, and a Frenchman holds a door for you, do not rebuke him ! He is trying to be nice, respectful and courteous and you would offend him seriously if you slam the door on his nose. Many American women do that and it is considered extremely rude !

      Incoterms are made to clarify international trade; that is, it defines clearly what the supplier's responsabilities are all along the transport of the goods and when the responsability is tranfered to the buyer, e.g. at departure (EXW), after being loaded on board of a boat (FOB), or at delivery, duty paid (DDP). It also clarify what the supplier is supporting in the name of the buyer, e.g. insurance and transport cost. Into EU, the incoterms are also used but generally simplified to only 2 over the 11 availables. Symply put, the sales are Ex Works (EXW) or Delivery At Place (DAP). Therefore, during the negociation of a sale with a customer, rather than spending time in the terms of the trade, i.e which responsablities are you offering to assume; you can focus on the additionnal services you wish to offer and indeed invoice. Look at it this way, EU offer a large market, with easy terms of trade for a more profitable activity. Mind you, EU is not the world and you should keep on trading out of.

Obviously, the great moment for this mission is at lunch, when you try to joke with your team and one thing leading to another you learn more about each colleague. Sometimes it could be funny...We often speak about problems of our work, there are many occasions where I understand why one or other one seems very tense. There are incompatibilities of characters so harmless chats can turn sour. It is always necessary to keep in mind that tomorrow we'll work together ...

We took the last boat of the day in order to reach the island. There wasn't any hotel on this island ; only a few bungalows managed by families.

The cottage has been recently renovated Its not in Ionian but Ithaca Island Its just 1 bedroom and the blight family needs 3 bedrooms I cant propose this cottage.  The second sale: Seafront Located in Kioni and not Ionian.  Does need some restoration and the blight family doesnt want to renovated so I cant propose this sale Spacious with 4 bedrooms The third sale: 3* 2 bedrooms with Vathy bay views Located in Ithaca and not Ionian. New residences so dont have to be renovated. I think its ideal, the single disadvantage is not located in Ionian.  The fourth sale : Ithaca Close the beaches. 3 apartments and 1 Studio I thing that the better investment is the third sales for the Blight familys.

      Dear James, Some serious problems have been brought to my attention relating to your working style and habits. This is a formal letter of warning to ask you to improve your work. Let me outline the areas in which you need to improve.First, it seems you don't think enough about teamwork. So, you have to talk to your colleagues about what you are doing. Then, you are very bad in time management. You must be more careful about it. Last, I have heard about you are a bit untidy. You have to be more professionnal. I hope you will pay attention to these advices.

      The most important thing to me in life is my family. That's where I came from and where I belong to. I always concern about their health and hapiness. I'm from South Korea and I'm actually living in France. It's been about five years since I started living alone. In the beginning, both my family and me experienced some difficulties seperating from each other. Besides, just before I came to France, I have had a serious agoraphobia. One day, I decided to change my life and start a new life in a new country. That's why I came to France. It was a challenge and I was afraid at first, but now, I think I made a great decision. My family encourage me and trust me. I'm doing well alone thanks for this support. If I hadn't challenged to start from zero, I wouldn't be changed. Trust yourself in order to make a real difference in your life! Go for it!

      There are more and more students in France and education sectors are developing. In France, there are a lot of test before university. But, when students arrived at university, the tests are every five months. A drawback is the trend to not find the good direction for studies and that's why many students don't arrive to make a good choice after their graduate. Alternatively, a benefits is that studies are often supported by the government to promote long studies and there are a lot of students of all the world who come to France to study.

We spend time together after work at midday and after 7 pm . We exercise every day and we stay motivated all the year. Either we do a workout at the gym or we go jogging on the beach.

I believe it will be cheaper to buy than to rent in a long run. First of all, redeeming a loan means gaining a bit of equity each month. Then I will feel free to make changes without depending on a landlord. In addition, interests are future tax deductions. Please find enclosed a complete budget outline. My income is about  2,000 and my monthly expenses amounts to  1,000 including a rent of  500 which afford  me to pay the monthly mortgage.

      Looking to the future I could be a manager. That's why I need to learn right now how to be a good leader. In my opinion I think that to be a good leader you have to be empathetic. It's important to be able to understand your employee's feelings. If they are in a good mood, if they share your vision. It's very important if you want them to achieve your goals. And it can be very useful to defuse conflicts. An excellent people skills is also necessary for being a good leader. For instance you should be able to set some activities for improving team building. By the same time, you will be able to know better your staff and to infer their best qualities and skills. You can also to be charismatic but it's not so important for me. Last but not least a leader has to be an example for his staff. You have to prove that you are competent, full of talent. If your staff admire you, they will follow you and your vision even through hardships.

      Ive been working as a financial broker for about 10 years. I enjoy my job which is challenging and exciting. Prior to that, I didnt really have any professional goals. After graduating in economics, I decided to gap a year in order to think about my professional carreer. When my father fell gravely ill, I had to abandon this plan. My father owned a clothing store and couldnt give up his activity. So, he asked me if I could run the shop until he recovered. Although I didnt dream of running a shop, I was forced to accept. This experience which lasted a year, was very difficult but also useful. Not only I had to manage the shop but had also to coach the employees. I learnt to be responsible. Following this job (when my father cured), I went back to school tow years and became a financial broker. Although my job is very interesting, it is also very stressful so that today, I plan to work in a different field. Why not buying land in order to lease plots of land to private  individuals? They could grow their own vegetables.

      Sales Figure for Best Books Company I'll try to explain and to compare both graphics: First of all, the continous line is for the National sales figures, whereas the dotted line is for the International sales figures. So, the International sales figures have increased sharply from 2004 to 2005, and then they fell down suddenly, to remain steady until 2007. After that, they have decreased sharply and are steadily since. Concerning the National sales figures, they have increased gradually until 2005, and then, remain steady. However, in 2006, we have seen a sharp increase during more than one year, but in 2007 they dropped abruptly for a few months and they fell gradually since there. Both of these sales figures are fluctuating a lot. Nowadays, the cost of living is more and more expensive, although the salary remain steady and, comparatively not raise enough. I think it's due to that!

      Regarding social and professional life, etiquette is still really important in France. Everybody is supposed to know some common rules as not putting elbows on the table while having lunch. But some rules are more subtle. They are a marker of social status. Many people don't realize how essential they are, or don't want to. But breaking them, can be harmful. For example, when a member of lower classes greet someone, he says 'Bonjour Monsieur Dupont&quot; whereas one of upper classes would say Bonjour Monsieur&quot; without the name. When you get into a drawing room, you have to kiss on the hand of the hostess, but not the hand of the other women who are guests. It would be very impolite. All of that could seem frivolous. It could be said: It doesn't matter. But in fact, that's not the case. It's necessary to sustain career and upward social mobility. For instance, as a partner of a law firm, I always pay attention to good manners of a candidate before hiring him, because some of our clients are extremely demanding on proper etiquette. It's a corporate identity's issue. So if I can give advice.%% You're expected to respect the customs, even if they can look like old fashioned. That the best method to work your way up the ranks.

Nevertheless, regarding our budget, we will exceed the plan by 10%. Primary cause is our lack of skilled people. I took decision to take temporary workers. It was crucial to hit the dealine. I reflected on the financial situation and came to the conclusion that we should meet our client. This customer added some new requirements which have not been budgeted at the beginning of the project. By having a face to face meeting with them, we will better explain overall situation and ask our respective team leaders from each department such as Engineering, Quality, Sourcing to get involved in that final negotiation. I've already asked them to get prepared and come with a power-point presentation that should be concise and effective to better convice our interlocutors.

      Hello Renee,  I enjoy to see your results. I'm not really surprised to see that people average have two TVs in their home. TV today is a really good means of communication. I have just one TV because I live in a flat. 16 hours is a lot for me I spend 3 hours a week I think, no more. I see generally the news and weather, and I relax me with some cartoons. I'm not like other people in the statistics because I hate sitcoms and reality TV.  I like to watch exiting movies with my friends, it's so fun!%% Write soon.

      Carry's been an invaluable member of our society since several months. She works hard and help us to be on the top. This is due, in large part, to her speed and relationship with clients. Moreover, she's always smiling and good at listening other people's ideas, so it's easy for managers to work with her. Maybe, her aggressive side could become a negative point. In fact, she's a slogger and she always really wants to win a project and work hard for it but sometimes, it could be too much. According to a poll, employees are more stressed since she manages the department. A point to clear up.

      I had been looking for jobs when my father suggested that I volunteer at a political organisation. What a fantatic experience! If only I had done that sooner, I would have realized that volunteering is a great way to network and meet peiple. Soon afterward, I had interviews at several companies whose employees had also volunteered. Following the interviews, I was offered a job with a large homebuilder. I was always determined to work in the real estate industry in some way, sharpe or form. I gladly took the and have remained passionate about my work ever since, although, frankly, things were difficult in the yeras after the buble burst. For the last five years, I have been negotiating purchase contracts at a successful real estate development company in the valley. As soon as the picks up enough, I hope to open my own development company.

      I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future. Indeed I think that pollution, poverty, inequality will improve. Particularly I believe that developing world will never have the same chances of success than richer countries. Richer countries had already made their laws in the global world, they had already exploited a major part of world's wealth. However I think that a lot a things will be improved in the future, like sciences, knowledges in medicine, technologies. All that improvements will necessarily lead to a better life for the most of people.

      Hi IanHow are you ? It's was good to talk to you yesterday. I was so sorry to hear you are not feeling well at the moment. I know that claustrophobia can be very embarrasing and annoying for your everyday life. I read a little bit about that and become aware of the difficulties you have to face in our office. Please, don't give up and don't resign ! We can all help you to get over of this trouble. First, we decided to remove the closet and put your table near the window, in front of the door. If you feel scared to be trapped or start to panic with feelings of anxiety with breathing problems, open the window, breath deeply and don't hesitate to call us before fainting....Just remember of your old friends and colleagues who need you with your enthusiasm and sense of responsability. You are a very talented young man and the office won't be the same without your presence. This phobia is very well known and I can give you the name of a good specialist. There are treatments and techniques to teach you how to deal with your symptoms (meditation, relaxation..or even drugs if you really need them). Go ahead and look after yourself. We want to see you back at work very soon.All the bestChris

      The &quot;Palais Bahia&quot; is my favourite restaurant. They serve authentic morroco food. My favourite main course is called &quot;Couscous&quot;, a north african specialty. It's based on cereal semolina. You can order a chicken couscous, but the baked leg of lamp couscous is fantastic.It' also served with some vegetables, like carrot, turnip and others, cooked in a spicy sauce. There're also chickpea. Due to this generous entree, you don't need to order a appetizers.

      In France, the bottom dropped out of the financial market has still a deep impact on unemployment rates. There are not a lot of job opportunities. Most of the time, there is only part-time jobs and salaries are very low. However, we all have an heath care insurance provided by the government, even for people who have no job. In order to understand better the situation in my country, it should be known that the companies and the government are in statu quo because companies and workers pay for the social politic and think that it's unjust and worst, they can't hire more people because of taxes they have to pay.

      I think it's necessary to better understand the needs of the students in France. In fact, for the counseling it's very difficult to make the good choices during the high school or sometimes before. The system of counseling don't listen enough the students, and the needs of the market. It's not unusual to see students make a mistake in the studies. Anybody listen to the students during my study to figure out who I was or what I wanted, but I think to pass my life and my project I liked that. After my degree, my goals change and in my country it's possible to go back to school and to make a internship. I'm in favor of them, it's very good to start a new career. In France, the new technology appear in the school and the flexibility too, but it's difficult with the mind and the education. In my business school, it's mandatory to have a computer to make a study. The trend is to give tests to students all the time, to see the level and to obtain a notation. But I think it's not a good way to learn.%% It's not good for the confidence and it encourage to fail.

      Nowadays in French society, equality between men and women is still an issue. Despite a lot of improvement in the last thirty years, there's still a lot of work to do for a real equality. For instance, men are better off women in terms of salary, position, respect. Why aren't we able to settle a real equality in our society ? In my opinion, works in general play a big role in this situation. But for women, in their carreer, there's the problem of their pregnancy. Because of that, they can't reach good position or have a good promotion. Everytime, before hiring or promoting a woman, firms always think about that. Could they be totally available for the compagny ? Could they cope with all the responsibilities ? Then, there's a lot of men running the highest position in compagny. Like that they continue to hire or promote men instead of women.

      In France, habits have changed regarding the role of males and females in the society. Nowadays, men take care of the children more and more often. However, there are still some stricking differences between men and women on that point. Fewer men stop to work or decide to work part-time to take care of their children indeed. Who knows, maybe this will be change in the near future. In companies, even if more and more women accede to management positions, there is a lot to do as regards equality. For example, certains managers prefer to hire a man than a woman old enough to have children. Moreover, women are still less paid than men for the same job in many companies. Why are there salary inequalities between men and women for the same job.

      We have a lot of farmers in my country. We also have a lot wolves. From a social point of view, I think it's safe to say that farmers and wolves don't get along. Wwolves kill farmers' animals, and so farmers kill wolves. Wolves are endangered now, which means there aren't a lot of them left. So the governement made a new law that it's illegal to kill a wolf. From an enviromental point of view, the law is probably a good idea, but what about the farmers ? If a farmer shoots a wolf now, he's a criminal. He has to pay a fine, or he might even go to prison.

      The cottage is pretty small, it only has one bedroom. Moreover, while it has recently been renovated, it still needs a new roof. The house is idealy situated on the coast, and seems to ooze with magic. On the other hand, it is in need on restoration. The new appartments are quite small, with only 2 bedrooms, which means that the boys would have to share a room. They are not expensive, but the family would probably prefer a house with history. The Villa is located in a quiet and traditional corner of the town, very close to the sea. It is surrounded by a wonderful landskape, with mountains and a bay. The family would have o possibility to rent the Villa while they are not there, which is one of thei wishes. It would be big enough for the boys to have their own bedroom, and there are no renovation needed. The price is high, but it shouldn't be a problem. I think it is the best choice for the Blight family.

Moreover, all these technologies will help us to be better. For example, doctors will do better diagnostics. However, it's true that we should be very careful with these technologies because we can kill many people in a little time with huge weapons like atomic bomb, and robots can be better than us so we will be theirs slaves.

      Dear Sir, I am writing to ask your advice about a problem I have with my landlord. I was the tenant of his house and I left it last week. I didnt cause any damage, however he refuses to give me my money back. He says the lights arent working, doors handles are faulty, one window is leaking and so on I realize I had these problems when I signed the contract but I thought my landlord fixed it. Can you tell me if Im entitled to get back my deposit and if you can help me. Regards, Alain Marchand

      I have never been working in a holiday camp for children. that is why I know none game for kids. I can only try to resume from memory the game with bottles proposed by your school. It is question of a cheap game built with bottles filled with water. The children have to knock down them with a frisbee. 10 turs each. The winner is the player with the most points. An advice : don't play wenn the weather is windy. End. When I record my voice, it is never good. I think that is it a problem at the beginning.%% Thank you for the attention to my answer.

      Just a few years ago, our reading was limited to the printed page. Digital publishing changed all that. People read on tablets, e-readers, laptops, desktop computers, phones and even wearable computers. Instead of carrying around a heavy backpack of textbooks, students can do all of their schoolwork on a tablet. What if you don't understand something in your digital textbook? Just tap on a link on your gadget; a pop-up window immediately provides you with helpful information. Even better, a video might pop up to provide an explanation. As a bonus, electronic communications media allows you to change the font size to make things easier to read.

      I live in France and many people are angry because prices are going up and up as unemployement's fast  increasing and salaries are decreasing. Right now, the price of housing is the biggest problem. It had hard increased for fifteen years and many people can't pay their rent. New taxs are created and the old ones are increasing. The cost of food is going up a lot slower but the quality is worse. Only technology prices are going down. These are problems of rich countries but they make people's life quite difficult.

      Is the question of gender always a real question? Yes! I recently moved from Norh of France to the South and it's really awful. The men are very macho and the women accept it very and... seem to like it! Here the men have to pay the bill, serve the wine. They are in the command for all the big companies and reach high distinctions whereas the woman are making efforts to be pretty, sexy and &quot;good to marry&quot;!!! Am in the stereotype! I'd really hope!!! Of course, even in South part of France, they are very nice men, who can have an understanding conversation. An they are a few strong women on the command... but who have to fight as lions and to prove their abilities each day!!! We have a lot of work for changing this!!!

      Hello everybody! I have just listened to &quot;Home Impovement&quot; of Josh Woodward. This song is so catchy, I can't get it out of my head. The melody is kind of sentimental, but the beat is quick and you can dance to it. The singer has a great range, his voice is plesant. He talks about social problems in US. So, sometimes, it's kind of sad. In the middle and at the end of the song, the singer hits the hight notes. The mood doesn't change a lot. I liked this song very much and I decided to buy the CD of Josh Woodward. You need to listen this song, I recommend it. Enjoy it! Bye.

So it should be the best place to live in. Many of you are confronted with some daily issues. If you elect me, Ill be your voice and your strenght. With your support, Ill make sure things will change for better. My first goal will be asking the board to reconsider the financial status of the students, in order to make our University a fairer place to learn. What if your teacher ask you to go abroad to sharpen your linguistic skills, and you dont have the money for it ? Founds can be raised to help everyone to go abroad, so that you all have equal chances. I have faith that you will trust me to support you.

      As findings from the survey, the most remarkable thing is the fact that when asked if they change their voices depending on whom they are talking to, more than 4 in 5 respond they are used to, especially to ensure they are understood or to add emphasis. According to the survey, two kinds of accents are the least popular, almost equally : those from the midland area for the UK wins 55% of the votes, against 45% for Liverpool's accents. We can note that almost three quarters of respondents say they have a kind of moderately strong accent and only 4% said they had a very strong accent, when 6% think of not having one at all. However when asked, 43% would change their voices if they could and 60% would prefer Standard English accent, when 35% said that it is the Scottish accent they would like the most.

      In France, manners and etiquette is fairly important. It's not only a matter of respect but a way of living as well. Recently, UNESCO has decided to include the french way of organizing a dinner or lunch as a part of the world heritage. That shows how much it's important for french to behave correctly when being invited but also to behave properly when inviting guests. When being invited, it's important to arrive on time or 10 minutes in late but never before. A host should never come without a small gift. Flowers or wine are always appreciated. From the host side, it's important to decorate the table and to invite the hosts to take place a woman near to a man and never two persons of the same gender nearby. The lunch or dinner should start with appetizer, then fish, meat, cheese, salad, dessert and coffee. Even if the lunch takes hours, it's really impolite to leave to go to smoke a cigarette for instance, or to call someone.

They finally found an agreement (the vendor let us the second model for a lower price), IXW bought the computers.

But that was nothing compared to her astonishment, when she understood that they were beginning to vandalize the local newsagent.  So, she decided to do something and she went toward them. But the young woman threatened her with a gun, she punched her in the stomach with it and stole her laptop! Meg was terrified. A man tried to help her, but he couldn't stop them. At the end, it appears the young woman was a teenager wearing a wig!%%

      Dear Teacher, I would like to be a good leader and this lesson will help me to think about this goal. First, communication is important but you need to be carefull of what you say and don't change your mind. Secondly, you must lead your employes, but don't give too much details. Then they will try to find solutions to achieve ours goals. As well I prefer to avoid to compliment my coworkers, then they will try to do a better job. Next, I will be an example if I work hard, late and effectively. I must think positively, by this way I have understood that critical are forbidden. I must have an argument of each critical about me to be protected. Of course, I will be carefull to not underestimate my coworker which one will try to be the leader. I know my strengths and weaknesses. In fact, speaking is my main weakness but it can be a strength, others don't know what I think. Finaly, I have learnt that if you do everything you will control enverything. Best regards

      Naturals remediesThe best naturals for pains is to made a tea with willow bark and cayenne pepper. Be careful, drink it warm, and try to drink that twice a day. With that, your pain disappears quickly and you will be better. You'll be in shape. It's a amazing remedy.If you have an infection, don't take antibiotics, prefer Garlic and Echinacea tea. The taste is not very good, but it's better for your body than antibiotic and it's a natural remedy.Do you have fever ? It's incredible, but wear socks soaked in vinegar an thyme. Disgusting but very efficiently.

      The buildings of Shanghai are simply breathtaking in their size and diversity. The city has an impressive number of modern skyscrapers  more than a thousand, according to some counts  that are in sharp contrast to several styles of architecture from different time periods. The Bund offers the perfect tour of sophisticated European buildings, many constructed in the mid-1800s to early 1900s in various gorgeous styles, including Renaissance, Baroque and neo-classical. The area is attractively situated along the Huangpu River. Look across the Huangpu for one of the city's most intriguing architectural contrasts: Pudong, with buildings that look like they belong in a science-fiction movie. Here, you'll immediately notice Shanghai's most famous building, the Oriental Pearl Tower. It's definitely not the world's most beautiful building, but it is one of the tallest (at 468 meters) and most unusual. The spire and antennas reach an impressive 118 meters high. Near the Pearl is the Shanghai World Financial Center, which, with 101 floors, is China's tallest building.

      In France, a trend is to bring new technology for the schools but also to change the schedule of students. So, it won't unusual for them to finish at 3 p.m this year, mainly in primary schools and middle-schools. In spite of that, there're problems with universities, in fact, everyone can study at university but inside there are too many large classes. After High-school, often there are few college counselor to give them information for the best choice of studies. So, many too of them fail their first year at college. But another trend is for many people going back to college. I'm in favor of that because we need to learn all time. So, many programs are developing and we can taking night course at university or online to get a certificate.

The bottles are lined up in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Each player is given a frisbee and is allowed to take two shots on each turn. Players are given a total of ten turns each. One point is scored for each pin that is knocked down. If a strike is scored (all the bottles are knocked down), then the player takes two more shots and all the points are added together.%% The winner is the player with the most points.

      In my opinion all the manners looklike almost the same in the world with just few differences concerning the celebrations and what kind of &quot;party&quot; or occasion could be. Per example, as I am from France, if you're invited to go in friend's house for dinner it's normal to bring a bottle of wine or some pastries or flowers also. But for this kind of dinner, there is no special clothes that you have to wear, altough it's better to wear clean and appropriate clothes. But, if it's for a wedding or a birthday and you will meet people that you never seen before it could be more appropriate to wear suit for men and dress for women. Concerning the manner during the dinner, the main guidelines are to wait before to eat that all the people are ready to eat, no drink too much alcohol, don't put the elbow on the table... In my experience, as I travelled a lot in Asia, I could see that is really diferent from European culture. Per exemple, my Asian Friends don't understand why French people stay during few hours during a dinner or lunch even for birthday or other kind of celebration.

No let much time of reply,this is the best way to show you're really pleased to be invited to this event. Even if you can't attend to this party, it's important to revert shortly to the host with your reply. If you accept this invitation, one of the etiquettes is to bring a little gift like bouquet of flowers or bottle of wine. When you're at the table , it 's important to keep in mind some goods manners like : don't start to eat meanwhile the host isn't yet arrived at his seat; don't speak with full mouth; don't answer to your cellphone at the table; let your napkin on your lap.

      i just heard a song by Josh Woodwart called 'Home Improvement' , a folk-rock tune, what a beautiful song! First, Josh sings quiet, low notes .Then the melody changes, and he sings the high notes a little louder. He has a great range and lightly hits the high notes. You can't really dance to this song because there is addictive beat and Josh's voice is rough and edgy. But the song has kind of a sentimental melody and a part of sadness who made me think about my romantic relationship.  Anyway, i recommend you this music you should listen to it.

      When you receive an invitation for a party, you must reply relatively quickly because your host can think you're waiting for a better invitation. At the party, it's thoughtful to bring a small gift , bottle of wine or flowers  to your hostess. You must be polite with the other friends and introduce yourself each other. When person are sit down,  if a woman or an elderly person come,  all the gentlemen would stand up. Don't take or receive phonecall, or send text messages with your smartphone . At dinner table, eat carefuly, slowly and  use cultery correctly .  Don't slurp ! Don't yell  or don't talk about politic, religion  or money. It&quot;s impolite to get up for going to the restroom when you are on the table. Put your napkin on your lap and don't put your elbows on the table. When you live the party,  said how happy you are and few days after send a short thank you note or email to your host.

      A career plan, as any plan, looks like a triangle : the top apex lists the objectives to achieve ; the two base apex are the initial situation and the idea we get on the future. In practical terms, Jim is an almost graduate student who, not very enthusiastically, contemplate the idea to work... so a gap year sounds to him like an interesting project. Nothing is told about the objectives to be achieved, so he will have to rely on the succession of his actions to draw a meaning from them a posteriori and to hope that this meaning will be satisfactory for him. He has the base of his triangle but not his top apex. He has no plan, of career or of whatever else.

      Well, in France studies in public schools are free, and they are better then in the privates one. But you must have high school diploma. So, at first, you have to know if you are able to go to high school. Now, the tend is to ofter every year new training, so I think you would find one which is good for you. It's common study 3 years in University, then, if you'd make the good choice, you can find a good job. I'm all for these trainings not too long!

      Long time ago I have been interesting in new technology. I can say that I was among the first ones in all my city to connect to the internet, 20 years ago. What has really changed my life is not exactly the new technology that we know today. More precisely it was computers and programs with spreadsheets and word processors. It was an incredible time saving and a great mean to sort datas and work with very quickly without risk to lose anything.  There was a downside, however. Every day, we must save the files onto hardware because we didn't have any possibility to do that on line. Curently, I use new technologies as smartphone, tablet, ereader in my professional activities. As a lot of people, I'm engrossed in internet but I'm mindfull about that kind of trap it can be, like a double-edged-sword with advantages and downsides.

      In my opinion, TV is too violent these days, For example, each evening, you can see one or more movie with ony violence or sex. I feel strongly that TV should be more educational, Documentaries are the best way to get an education from TV. For example, you can learn about space, you can see countries that you never visited. With Cable channels, it's easier to have educational channel, and you can visit the world from your home. However you canhave a help with the rating system, and if you have young children, it's not a too bad system.

      The 200,000 euros cottage isn't suitable because it hasn't enough rooms for two young boys, the roof needs renewing although its location gives a great view of sunset over the Strait between Kefalonia and Ithaca. The 1.5 millions euros Hamilton house is an ancient and historic house of Elizabeth Hamilton ( 115 year old house), located in Kioni, Ithaca, in one of the most picturesque village, on the seafront. It is ideal to be tranfered into a hotel ( suits the purpose of the buyer who wants to rent it out during their absence), the house is spacious enough but requires some restoration ( undesired). The news apartments are comfortable, stunning, overlook the Vathy bay. Despite its large surface and the possibility to make it rentable, these 2- bedroom apartments are still small for this family with two young boys. The 450,000 euros villa est the most suitable for the buyers. It fulfills their needs and desires. The land is large, located near the beach, in good condition and well-equipped. There are rooms for two young boys, the parents and guests. It offers a picturesque view on bay, whole village and mountain scapes. It's possible for business purposes while they are absent. No renovation is required.

      We are more and more confronted to a multitude of rules and regulations in any domain. Why is it so? I think that the main reason is that nowadays, whoever has an injury for example, will try to find a responsible person or community, in order to have someone else endorse the fees. Mr Smith walks in a park. He wants to approach the beautiful ducks swimming in a pond. But he slips and falls in the pond and break his leg. He will complain against the municipality, which did not install protections around the pond, or let it be too slippery. The next day, the authorities will plant a panel prohibiting to walk out of the walkpaths. And a new regulation was born !

      Marke an area about 8 meters x by 3 meters as the &quot;bowling alley&quot;. Use ten plastic bottles as the &quot;bowling pins&quot;. Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling. Give a frisbee to each player who is allowed to take two shots on each turn and get a total of ten turns each. The player who knocks down the pin scores a point. If a player scores a &quot;strike&quot;, he takes two more shot and adds all the points together. The player with the most points wins. Don't play on a very windy day !

      In my opinion, french TV isn't very good. For many reasons. There are a lot of reality shows and I think that this kind of show is silly. The TV isn't educational and it's very difficult for the parents to find something good for the children. There are also in France a lot of advertisements! It's very boring. And like in USA, there is a lot of violence and sex in programs and even in ads. It's dangerous for the kids to watch that. And the tv rating isn't good and useful!

      Report: Concerning the Sales Figures of the 'Manbag' in Asia and South America Introduction:  This report was requested by Bill Samson, CEO of New Line Clothing &amp; Accessories, to understand why sales of 'manbags' are so bad in South America compared to Asia.  Methodology :  Samples of 1000 people covering all the demographics, one in Rio de Janeiro and another one in Shangha,  were questioned as to their responses to the 'manbag'.  Findings:  - The product is not approved by 65% in Rio (vs only 20 in Shangha) - Only 20% would buy in Rio (vs 40% in Shangha) - The main reasons for disapproval are : Design, Size, Color, Material.  Conclusions:  - tastes are different among regions over the world - not enough market research was carried out before launching Recommendations: - do more research about what men want and need in an accessory - Main things to change for Manbag in South America are :  - a more sporty design,  - a slighty bigger size - strong primary colors and B&amp;W - leather as best material

      I think Gavin Taylor and his wife have gradually made their advertising. They used to instrument tabloids. I can't believe they have decided to divorce. Last month, they were both in Italia. All magazines showed them in Venice. They seemed to be happy, in love. On the &quot;San Marco&quot; place, Alana was laughing and today, nobody can imagine that their separation is true. Definitively, it is a huge gossip, an organized rumour to serving their public fame.

      In France, it's unusual to use technology in class because it's a public system and families don't pay to access the school. However, there are private school where you pay to go there and they can use easier technology to learn . I think it's wrong to use constantly new technology in school because children always choose this solution to work and they must learn to live without. In addition, for us, new technology is a way to play online with another children. They don&quot;t understand that we can use it to work and to learn more.

      Dear Paula, I am glad you have managed to find a new job in the serious world economic situation we are facing nowadays. Despite your request, I am not a big proponent of cutting on food expenses and you must always consider not giving up on a healthy and balanced diet. Nonetheless, I see some daily habits that can be considered extravagant in your new financial condition. First of all, I would suggest that you start planning your time at home differently. Your main problem seems to be time management. Find a way to drink your coffee at home! You can find some interesting products in your supermarket, even some inexpensive drinks that might taste better than the one you usually take. Continuing with the same idea, find some time to prepare your lunch in the evening before. Just think about the advantages: you can have homemade food everyday, you can choose the menu you want and you just have to heat it. I know it will be hard in the beginning, but once you've get used to it, you'll notice the difference in your wallet and in your health. Finally, the last but not the least, instead of meeting with your friends downtown, I would suggest you could meet in each other's place. Everyone brings something and in the end you'll feel more comfortable, free to talk and laugh loud and your friends will love this idea. I really hope I could help and I'm looking forward to know if these suggestions made a difference in your new lifestyle. Best regards.

      I have just finish to listen &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by josh Woodward. my first impression is good. It isn't an incredible song but it's sympatic. The singer voice isn't amazing, this range isn't large. But this voice is fine and clear and little rough. It is a good mix. The instrumental part is very simple, for me it is a pop rock tune. About the lyrics, I am sorry but I don't understand every lyrics, It's hard to give my opinion on this topic. To conclude I recommend this song because if you listen three or four time, you will finish by understand the liyrics. And you are not annoying by the song. Well done thank you.

      I will give my opinion about the two important e-commerce website.  First the most important point you need for search what do you want is a research system. On the nileretail.com you can find quikcly your book because this website use a different categories : specifics genres ... If you compare at the shopping-space website you will win a lot of time.  The second point is a quality of the book and there also nileretail.com is better than shopping-space. This last website has poor quality book compare than the first website.  The payments methods and the delivery is very excaustive on nileretail compare than the second website.  You can also buy a electronic book on the first website and the Customer services is better than the shopping-space. In conclusion nileretail win this comparative review and is recommanded if you want buy a variate book on your kindle or delivery at home.

      Hello Paula . May i respond to your letter . I think you need to change your food's habits . As we can see you like drinking a double latte .You should remplace it by a coffee .It's less expensive and certainly better for your health . For lunch my advice is to not buy anything in a supermarket .you should cook something at your home . You can save money and the food will be better for you . You have to avoid as much as possible to go to the restaurant .It's very expensive . You should find a new job well payed and then you will go to the restaurant .Don't forget that it is certainly more tasting if you cook yourself food instead of going to the restaurant .For you health you have to be aware that ready meals is very bad for your health .There are a lot of hidden sugar and others chemical products . In a conclusion , even if you earn a lot money continue to cook yourself .The taste is better . Bye Paula

      In Colombia, where I was born, there are too many strict laws but I'm fed up with those because no body follows it. Normally you can't drive while talking by phone or even worse if you are drunk. Another thing I find wrong is that the fine to pay depends on who is the violator, for example, if is the president who is making the infraction, he won't pay anything or he will get a discount, by the other side, if is somebody like me, I'm going to prison and I have to pay a several fine. I think the results are the same even if I or the president are the law's violator. People are afraid because the laws are not equalities on each side.

      I had recently a unique opportunity to present our marketing strategy to our board of directors . All in all the presentation went well. Nevertheless I was highly stressed and I got a little bit frustrated when the first questions came up. In actual fact I strived to explain in details how the market has been evolving lately and how we could face the changes by using them in a positive manner . Instead of trying to understand the reasoning behind this , I got stupid questions about the fundamentals of our market. Things which should be well known from people managing the company for years . The only clever question I got was from our CEO who asked me : ' Hey, but what is the return on this huge investment ?' . Fortunately I was well prepared to this question and was able to provide the board with all the necessary details .  I look forward to meeting them again following the implementation of our strategy.

It is not a solution to avoid this problem like you do. - And in a first time, you could move to a new flat?

      Dear M. Martin, I think I'm the perfect candidate for the job. I've always loved sports and to become a Personal Trainer has established itself as a very young age. Immediately after my studies of Physical Health and Fitness Education at Long Island of University, I worked three years like a Personal Trainer at PKO Body centre. It was a very interesting experience. You can see all my skills in my CV. After that, I wanted to teach young people to take advantage of my experience and I spent seven years at Strathmore High School. All this experiences gave me excellent communication skills and a vast knowledge of all aspects of fitness. Furthermore my enthusiasm and my strong motivation appeal to students. I look forward to hear you. Best regards.

The COO proposed to merger of both company, He think we have to find a new place, a new warehouse to gather companies. The CFO wasn't fully agreed with that. He argued that we have to think more about the gathering, he added that it is risky, we could lose a lot of money if the gathering is not correctly thought. So he concluded that we have to wait few months before think about a gathering. The CEO agreed with this proposition.

      In France it 's important to have good manners. We are famous for our politess and good etiquette in a hight society. When you meet someone that you don't know, you should put one's hands together and not to kiss on  cheeks. It 's really inappropriate to call with fist name at the beginning. If you're invited  at a dinner you're supposed to eat properly with a fork not with your fingers. and not burping,or slurping your drink. You 're expected to stay at the table and not going to the restroon during the meal. You don't ask personnel question. That are considered offensive to speak about money .You 're supposed to  send a thank- you note some days after.

The singer, Josh Woodward, hits some really appropiate notes. They make the song really catchy . The melody' s song makes me feel happy. I listenined to it twice. You can really dance on it and the sound is pleasant. The lyrics are a kind of humouristic and sentimental because the singer talks about his home and changement. There's not much of a change in mood all over the song but i like it. I really recommend this music

The boat wasn't new and comfortable as it could be expected but it was an old, slow ship and there was a problem with its engine. The cabin was dirty, the bathroom disgusting. The captain was supposed to care about us but it seemed he liked better sleeping in his cabin than being attentive to our needs. Moreover, he was rather unfriendly. The seldom animals we could see were some eagles. Nothing else! What about dolphins, bears, mooses and so on? Whereas it was announced in your advertisement that the package included all the expenses, we had to pay a lot of extra charges. This trip was really a trip like no other: it was the awfulest trip I made!

      In the future, life will not be the same as it is now. Furthermore, due to new technologies, life will be totally assistated. Most of people will use robots for doing daily works. On that point, I am rather pessimistic but, I find it hard to think that evolution will just be bad for life. Indeed, new telecommunications will increase distances between people.

      This graph compares the national and international sales of the best books in the company. We can see that from 2004 to june 2005, the number of international sales rose twice as much as the national sales. But in june 2005, the international sales dropped dramatically, and became in 2006 less important than the national sales. Then it decreased steadily until 2007, when it dropped sharply again. Since february 2007, the international sales are constant. On the opposite, the national sales had constantly increased to reach a peak in march 2007. Then, it decreased significantly until june 2007 to steadily decreasing ever since.

      Hi Rene. As you know, I recevied the survey too. I did it yesturday. I have just received the result and I am a little bit suprised. People seems to have a very different habits with the TV. In my age group, news is not a popular program. I should turn on Tv everyday to watch the news. It's very important for my business as you know. According to the survey, most of white collar watch news the evening. In my opinion, it's very strange. It's not possible to forecast business without the news. It's pity. I have wasted my time.

      Hi!The survey, generally, indicates that the most popular programs are &quot;News & Weather&quot; and &quot;Movies&quot;. My age group is between 19 and 30. And as far as I'm concerned, I prefer soap operas and Reality TV, as the survey shows it for my age group. The ratings underline that talk shows, cartoons and game shows are the programs the least watched. I disagree with for the talk shows, which are for me very interesting. They are a part of the news. I'm a female student and it's true that I watch more the TV in the evening and i prefer romantic movies. So, I think that this survey is rather good!

      I agree with &quot;taylor'sthebest&quot; and &quot;garvin'sgirl&quot;, media always make things up, Gavin Taylor's wife can't suing him for divorce, that's impossible. In my opinion, someone is trying to frame him for money because when you're rich you're easily an aim for scandal. The media often makes stories with lies, so this love's scandal must be one more lie. You shouldn't believe in all the things that the media say, Gavin Taylor is probably not unfaithful. The only thing that we are sure is that he got a lot of money which brings a lot of jealousy.

      Oh My God! My new car has changed my life. Before I got it, I'd been using public transports; Everydays, I were obliged to wait my bus, then to take the metro and finaly to try to catch a tramway. Yes, that was my life, and believe me, I spare you details. But with my car, I put less than 20 minutes to arrive at my university; I can listen musics and leave home at my time without any concerns. That's an exquisite situation. Of course, I spend a lot of money for the petrol or the maintenance of my car, but I think, it's worth it. I mean, public transport's fares were more expensive as soon as we grouped them by month.

The former financial crisis showed us how all our business could be weakened. That's why I'm quite pessimistic, more today than before, and I refuse to plan my career or my family life. My dreams are no longer relevant. However, I try to do the best to be healthy and to save enough money to be secured.

      According to the author, it is simple and common to change a career path. Contrary to what is commonly believe, diverse studies estimate that anyone could change 5 or 9 time. So with this book, the dilemma of 'is it a good idea to change my career path?' seems more normal. Furthermore, the author gives some keys to do it and she summarizes this approach into 2 steps:  - Learn to know what is our real personnality, our hobbies, what is important for us in our work, - Then, find a job that matches up with our wishes. However, it can appear a little bit too simple... and unrealistic. In my view, it is also important to really understant why you want to change your career path. Moreover, you have to be aware if it is possible or not for you to change your career path, especially with the actual hard labor market.%%..

      lets start with international sales figures: we can note that it increased very fast during the 9-10 first month of 2004. Then the growth has slowed to mid 2005. After that, a very strong decrease during 2 months. Maybe a crisis on the international market. Since that date, the international sales never stop to decrease more or less rapidly. However, this is different for the national sales figures. Thegrowth was slower but continuous during the all year 2005 and after a stop during 2006, it resumed again until early 2007. During the year 2007, the national sales decreased rapidly, since the international sales in 2005. For now, it's still decreasing.

      Dear Paula, I write you back about your question on how you can change your habits and start economizing. First, every morning, avoid buying coffee on your way to work. I suggest you wake up early and take a breakfast in your home before going. Second, when it's time for lunch, I think you should prepare something in your home. Third, when you meet your friends, you can have fun without spend lot of money in some best restaurants. You could have a little drink for example in some bars. Finally, all these suggestions could make you earn some money. I know there are big sacrifices but you need it at this time. Hope it could help you. Fabrice.

All days my colleagues are very stressed because the production that the costumer request is not ready in time, so all the time the people run everywhere to make sure the delivery products. When I am in my office I try not to stress and I think about the beach for example, and it's a really therapy to keep me calm. I'm working around 45 hours per week, and I am comfortable whit that, otherwise I could not do all my job.

      Wouaw ! What a good movie ! One of the best I ever watched. When I left the movie theater my hands were shaking so much ! Why did I love so much this movie ? Because it brought me emotions, because the actors were superb, the special effects were amazing, the soundtrack had themes that I'll remember all my life, the plot was well introduce in the movie,etc. I'd like to say something else about my first opinion (it brought me emotions), because what charecterizes a good movie for me is when we care about the heroes, when we think we are the movie and how much we want the enemies to be defeat. In conclusion, I really recommend this movie to everybody who wants to see a special movie.

      I feel strongly there are too many violence  and dumm entertainment at the french tv. For exemple arounf 8pm you can see the at all channels the same programm , I mean the news with a lot of violence ( wars, murders,terrorism , natural disaster....) with very realistic views. You can't escape of it .To forget that, you can watch a stupid reality show or a stupid game where the participants are always dumm and vulgar. Fortunately we have ARTE ! A very interesting cultural channel which mixes German and French programms. That's better than nothing.

      I still dont have a smartphone and actually I just bought my mobile phone one week ago! Before I bought it I had been sending emails to my friends or colleagues, and it was quite enough. But, to be honest I was using my girlfriends phone. So, thats definitely not the mobile phone which had an impact on my life but internet connection. During one month this year I couldnt surf the web at all. Life is undeniably slower without internet. I read a lot, and thought more by myself. However, when I got it back, I was very happy to be able to see and chat online with my family and friends, they lived at 12000km to my home so its crucial to me to have internet, not to mention the access on media it provides us.

      I think Jeremy is an excellent team member. He is friendly and confident, very communicative and cooperative : he always knows how to work with others and help them. He is the one who talk to chiefs when there is a problem, and he is the one they listen to (the most) whatever happen. And he is also good at solving problems on his own, even under pressure, without wasting time nor making error. He is really assertive of each task he performed well and it gives confidence to others. He works hard, is very competitive, but never asks for anything. (He would have had a promotion if, less nice, he had dared to ask...) Nevertheless he also has a small aggressive side, in debates and negotiations, esteemed unanimously during the signing of contracts; but he is (too) good at compromising even if he is right. Everybody can count on him.

      When I was growing up, I read books printed on paper. I'd read anything- graphic novels; autobiographies; bike magazines; and my favourite, science fiction. Somewhere along the way, I've transitioned from paper to electronic media. In the early 2000s, I read my first e-book. It was a 1950s romantic:&quot;their Eyes were watching GOD,&quot; written by Zora Neale Hurston, written before digital communications media was even born. Now, I read my novels and news on a tablet. I do research for work on search engines, blogs, magazines and online dictionaries. I've noticed some huge diffrences in my habits, too. With paper media, I would use my fingers to turn a page; with electronic media, I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page. Sometimes news articles contains links. I can tap the link and be taken to an entirely new world of information. In fact, I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals. None of this was possible with paper books and, frankly, sometimes all this digital interaction can become a little distracting. In all, however, I enjoy it.

      French Can-Can comes from France , Paris city exactly. This dance appeared in the end of nineteenth century. Even if now we can see French Can-Can's shows over the world, we have to keep in mind the French Can-Can takes his origin in Paris and in typical and famous french cabarets. This dance is one of a kind, for two reasons : Firstly, this dance has been considered like a first step of women emancipation, and not really accepted by one part of the society during this period. Secondly this dance can be considered like Eiffel Tower, is a characteristic of Paris. French can-can is today a real touristic attraction, French can-can show allows to tourists to find the atmosphere of this old and crazy Paris which was unique to this period of nineteenth century. Besides to dive the spectator into a magic atmosphere , French can-can show is simply beautiful, the dance requires many physical performances.

      The first property is a cottage. It has a wonderful view and has been completly renovated, except the roof, which needs to be replaced. The price is very attractive, but I think this cottage is too small for this family: they have two sons, and there is only one bedroom. The second property is much more expensive (1.5 million euros), but money is no object for this family. Unfortunalely, this villa needs some restoration! The third property is cheaper, but too small for this family. The fourth house for sale should meet all the needs of the Blights: it is located in Vathy, the capital of the island. It is close to the village and the beaches. Mrs and Mr Blight are looking for an investment property, as they would like to rent. I think that this property is the most convenient for them.

      One of trend of french education is that french schools, or universities, are free. You have just to pay the entrance cost. People they haven't money can study after high school certificate. Another trend of system education is that universities are near big cities in France and my country is not big. It's easy going study with transportations. We don't need to rent a flat. But the most concentration of private schools, or thematic schools is in Paris. All students would study in this city because of entertainment, and it's commom to not find quickly a flat or it's usual to pay that expensively.

When I saw her face, I undersantood that I had upset because I told her she didn't want to hear...One year later, when we have been training together our internship, we discussed that our first meeting and we laughed a lot. Indeed, during the course, we had a great time together. She realized that I was a very funny person. And me, I found a great friend. Fanny is a beautiful girl, she's very interresting and very brave. We will book a congress of emergency medicine in october and we will take a lot of beer and we will do a party!!!

      I am optimistic about the future, there is so many technology in this new world. And sometimes I can't believe what I see. For exemple, with our mobile phone now we can buy what we want without to go to the shop. Also,to have a job we can make an interview by skype. Everything is going to be easier. But I am as well pessimistic, if you don't need to go to the shop to buy your food or anyway, that's mean you don't have to make an effort. And this way it's wrong for me. In conclusion, the new technology can be a good evolution for human but we have to think about the realistic, what we really need to stay with a good health by exemple. If we make less efforts, our lifestyle can change in the bad way. It's important for human to have real contact with people.

      I'm 19 years old, I'm studying at university, in France. Last year I graduated from high school. My first year at university was pretty funny, and a little hard. I had to work much more than in high school. But I really want to be an engineer, so I do all I can for this. I have a certain amount of stress, but I'm healthy. Although I had to work hard, I also could go to parties with new friends who I met while the integration's week. I have no real money worries because my parents support me financially. They offer me a suitable atmosphere to work and I'm aware that It will can't stay like this all time, maybe until I have my diploma of engineer. I have a nice life. I hope that by the time I'm 30, I'll have a good situation, I'll be well-paid and I'll support a family. And I'll be glad at work. It's all I want.

      Life is full of lessons. However, the most important one I learned all on my own: Be yourself. I mean, make a point of not depending from other people to achieve your goals. By acting and behaving independent, you will be the only person responsible for the good things and bad things that happen to you. I won't say that I haven't made bad decisions, because everyone does. However, the best decisions are ones that I have made. No parent or friend can teach me how to be myself. It's important to have positive thinking. Positive thinking makes you feel good about yourself. It makes you feel more confident and gives you the strength to face any hurdle in life. As long as you fill your mind with positivity, it will help you achieve your dreams and will keep you happy everyday.

      To improve the management strategy of a company, I would suggest to set up a Balanced Scorecard (BSC). It is a brand new management system, it's efficiency has been proved and it has the advantages to link all the part of the company whatever the hierarchical level. Indeed, the BSC is composed by 4 axes which are the guarantor of the membership of everybody in the company : there is a financial axis, a customer axis, an axis organizational process and a dedicated axis for learning and growth. Thanks to this 4 axes, the financial axis will play a less important role whereas the stakeholders could express their voices! For example, employees will pick up data during their day to day worklife and will give their feedback about what are company's strengths and weaknesses. In the same way, the customer will have the opportunity to express their wishes and desires. Moreover, all the data collected will be automatically sent to the company data base and the BSC in order to be sort and thereby help the top management to make the right decision taking in consideration all the actors of the company.

      As she was going to work, my sister saw a nice sunny morning turning into a true nightmare. She was carrying her coffee in one hand, her laptop in the other and her handbag over her shoulder. Suddenly, a couple came out of a car, letting the engine running and the music playing. They started to vandalize the local of newsagents. As she tryied to stop them, my sister was threatened by the woman who carried a gun and pushed it into her stomach ! She was shaking and was very scared. Even if it seemed to be a lifetime, it must have lasted a few seconds. The woman talked about the consumerism and the evil of modern lifestyle and then took my laptop's sister. A man, who was passing by, caugh the woman by her hair but it was a wig. The woman was in fact a young boy! The couple is still at large and my sister still scared. This morning she understood that even a beautiful morning could turn into a very bad day !

      It's was the first time I listened to this song by Josh Woodward called &quot;Home improvement&quot;. I never heard about him before. He is a sentimental singer. I don't really understand why he chose to talk about this topic, but it seems to be invested in it. I believe that he has written this song himself. The lyrics are pretty sad, so the mood of the song is sad too. The beat is quick and really addictive ! Now, I can't get it out of my head. However the song has kind of a repetitive melody, I think because the most important are lyrics and not tune. The singer hits sometimes high notes, in order to emphasize the meaning of the lyrics. He interpretates well this song.

      In France, the trend is not to give tests to student more often along the year. In the end of the year, students have an exam.I'm against exam when a serious student fail the grade.For me, I prefer tests more often in the year because if a student fail one test he can have a better note an other test. In France , it is anusual to see older people in a college. But an old person can pass an exam in the end of the year. I think it is a good thing.

      Technology has completely changed my professional life, not so much my private life. Let me elaborate a little bit what I want to say. When I joined my company, thirty years ago, email or cell phone did not exist yet and we spent hours on the phone spending our time at our desk . Today , thanks to emails or cell phones, you can be reached almost wherever you are . However this is a double edged sword as there is a tendency to consider that you are supposed to be very reactive , much more than in the past because you have got new tools. An other trend is the over use of audio conferences involving people who are using their cell phones (because they are travelling or for any other reason). To me this should be an exception as it is poor communication. In my private life, I do not think technology has really changed anything.

      It seems to me that successful people have many points in common. First, they live their lives in a positive way. They never stand too long on negative points and always think about what should be the next step to succeed. Whatever happens to them, they are ready to bounce back. In addition to that, they are persistant, passionate and ready to adapt themselves (or their ideas) to the market's needs. Of course, they also have a strong need to be their own boss and need to do things in their own way. However, sometimes, you can meet people who have successful people's traits and habits but are considered by other people as &quot;loosers&quot;. Yet, when you talk to them, you are surprised to see they still believe in themselves, feeling that one day their turn will come up and they will be successful. To do so, they will need the only thing you have to get to be successful : the idea ! Without it, they will continue to be a successful person only in their own fantasy world.

      The movie &quot;A monster in the land&quot; by Bob Lawrence Pitch: The story is about a police investigation. We have a murderer and three victims. The injuries are very curious. Perhaps an wild animal but each murder is during the same day every thuesday. A woman with a terrible dog is behind this story. A old story of revenge. Actors: -The detective, a man with strong presence, charismatic, fifty years old. -The murder, a woman with a big authority. -A dog, well dressed with its master. Other: - The location is the countryside. We must have a good director of photography able to capture the light. - A good jimmy jib because some scenes are particulary difficult. -A good choreagrapher for the pursuit scene in the forest. -A good sountracker is necessary to create an atmosphere of terror. The cry of the animals must be very realistic. -For the script, stunt hunter, gaffer, technician I work with my usualy team. Best regards Bob Lawrence, director

      In 1983 the french parliament voted a law on the base of which the equality of treatment between men and women became a general rule. Why do men should be more paid or more quickly promoted than women ? During the last thirty years, the goverments had to do actions for the 1983's rule to be respected. In spite of that there remains differences even though, we can notice that a few companies has decided to practice a strict equality of salary. Sometimes it's a way to appear as socially respectful because it's a criteria to be chosen by a new kind of active shareholders. Will the money change the mentalities ? That sounds a little strange

      Dear Mayor Bleak,I am writing to you to express my feelings as well as local residents' concern about Super-Mart's construction.It is said that Super-Mart brings advantages to our village such as shopping convenience, low- prices, employment, and local economic support. However, compared with its negative influences, this comfort is a disastrous camouflage. Have you ever think about the closing down of existing small businesses because of their low priced offers? Moreover, the new jobs available in Super-Mart are minimum paid without social and health care benefits. Futhermore, suitable jobs are reserved for Super-Mart's special personnels, which partially pushes our local students to leave to work in another cities.Another reason I'd like to point out is that no more budget is used for local community development and support. If this happens, our village is not beneficial to live, and to learn, because there is no money to maintain extra-curricular activities for students, as non-profit organizations are being shut down.I want to reiterate that Super-Mart is not necessary for us and I'd like to ask you to reconsider its construction and to think about how good our life will be without it.Sincerely yours,

      CSR is a very controversial issue which relates to many political, economic and ethical discussions. On the one hand, some people believe that CSR is a way to make the private companies look good and helpful. At best, it would be a PR trick, a publicity stunt or a marketing device. At worse, it would be a way of demotivating workers to fight for their rights and to engage in social struggle. It's the point of view of left wing politicians. On the other hand, most people are convinced that companies have a real responsibility to the community they belong to. Companies aren't only committed to their shareholders but also to all the stakeholders with which they have to deal: workforce, clients, local authorities, people living in the neighborhood, state. Doing good for everybody, including the disadvantaged people, is the core value of the free market economy which have always been related to philanthropy. American capitalists, who set up powerful foundations, are perfect example. In fact CSR is a new word for an old concept: Charity. The time has gone when the wealthiest simply donate directly to people in need.  Time has come when legal people do what natural people did.%% Thats what CSR make possible nowadays.

      The city of Lyon, formely known as Lugdunum during the ancient rome houses a lot of famous buildings or square to visit. The most famous square is the Place Bellecour which is the largest clear square of Europe with around 62 000 square meters. In the middle of the &quot;Place Bellecour&quot; there is a famous sculpture which is a horse mounted by the king Louis XIV. With regards to buildings, the tallest one is the&quot; Tour du Credit Lyonnais&quot; with rised to 165 meters and has 42 floors. The building is known for his shape of a pencil. In France, this building is the 10th highest skycrapers, the nine other tallest skycrapers or all located in Paris. I cannot finish this article without talking about the Mettalic tower of Fourviere which was built between 1892 and 1894 and has a striking ressemblance with the Eiffel Tower. Nowadays the tower serves only as a television relay tower.

John said me that it was a good idea because there were fresh and comen from Normandie. For the main course we took salmon which came with asparagus. As we didn't know which white wine could be great with our courses, John proposed us a local one. We also ordered a litter of sparkling mineral water. The wine was also perfect with the cheesecake.

      At first glance, it was a beautiful sunny day when she went into the Coffee Pot as usual. On second thoughts, she attended a violent incident when a young couple got out of a car and committed acts of vandalism against newsagents. They used a hammer to break the windows. She naively decided to go over them to discuss with them. Suddenly, irreparable harm has been done when one of the young couple, which was the woman came at her waving a gun. She spoke fast and nobody couldn't understand what she said. She also wondered if the young woman wanted to shoot her, but finally she ran away. A passer-by managed to chase and catch her by the hair. The person wore a wig; it was a teenage boy and not a woman! Surely, it was the most Meg's terrifying day because it could have been the last day of her lifetime.

      I am well up in years, and I started working before the computer era... I remember my first desk calculator was not electric, but manual, with a crank... A couple of years later, my company started to use computers for the quotations. The engineer filled forms with description, quantity and unit prices, and that was encoded and sent to US, across the ocean, in the evening. The next day, the quotation came back, on wide sheets... The secretary had to retype it all. In 1979, I was sent to Cairo. One only started talking of the fax. It was not reliable yet, and moreover, the communications with Cairo were tough. I used the telex of an hotel to communicate. No schematics nor pictures, of course. That was tedious. How times have changed ! Now, I enter my data on my computer from my desk. The finalized quotation, in due form, comes out of my printer, and I am able to phone and send pictures everywhere in the world... Yes technology has changed my professional life !

      Having a model or an ideal is very important to be guided in life towards the path of sucess. If  we do not have necesserly a person we admire, we have at least an idea about it. Let me give you some insights about my personal idea of a successful person. To me sucess is not all about money. Actually, it is not at all a money matter. Somebody is not sucessful because he is rich but he is rich because he is sucessful. Indeed, I will define the fact of being successful as being able to overcome difficulties and failures to finally achieve to master a specific topic and being acknowledged  by others for that. In fact,there are different manners of sucess. We can be sucessful in business by achieving a great career or being an entrepreneur with a fast-growing company. But we can also be seen as a sucessful person if we have  life-enhancing hobbies or an acknowledged mastery of a musical instrument. To concIude, I want to underline the fact that I admire people who can go further than everyone else in their specific domain. Whatever the domain is, Business or academic knowledge.

      I don't like the extreme sports. I am not a thrill-seeker. I have never taken up hang gliding, skydiving, down hill skiing etc. I'm 67 years old, and I 'm going to describe you the only small experience in this domain. Last year, my wife and I took our 2 grandsons a course in trees. Our grandsons, of course, were enthusiastic, but were needed an adult guide. Guess who had to go down...not my wife, me. At first, I faced my fear of heights, but little by little I did the course without too many problems. It is neceesary to that we were girthed well and the course was made safe. It was amazing...Once I got up there, I wasn't afraid and I finished the course quietly. After that, my grandsons pulled us in the sledging strip... Sometimes, it is difficult to be a grandfather...

      When I was growing up ,I read constantly traditional books printed on paper.I'd read a lot of historical romans -my favourite literature and crime fiction,adventure novels...Nowadays there are many kinds of electronic media,it's amazing transition from paper to e-books.Now I read my novels and news on a tablet. It's possible now to make research for work on search engines,blogs,e-magaazines and online dictionaries.It's an amazing speed!You just need to blink your eye to turn the page. With paper media ,I would use my fingers to turn a page ;with e-media ,I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page.It's very useful for my studies and enable me to save my time.

      I live in Paris but I am originally from senegal, so I want to describe the senegalese culture. In Senegal, people are not demanding with tourists or someone originally from other countries. However, they are very demanding with their family firstly, and with others senegalese wheter they lives in Senegal or in France or in other countries. Indeed, we have to pay a lot of attention to old people : our mothers, our aunts or any old people that we met in our lives. When you come from an occidental country, you're expected to provide gifts to all your family; this can be really constraignant. You should visit each of them, one after another for given gifts. There, it's extremely rude to come in a house whithout anything to give.

      Natural remedies.For a sore throat, a spoonful of honey and ginger will help young people who like sweet products.For pain, the ideal remedy is a tea made from white willow bark; it has the same effect as aspirin and cayenne pepper is excellent for desinfection. It's a good remedy for everybody.For aches and pains, put a hot mixture of vinegar, olive oil, and eucalyptus . So it's fantastic, everybody can use it because it's not necessary to drink it.

      I am really no good at music, but as a friend of mine ask me to talk about a song by Josh Woodward, I am going to try to play music criticals. I listened very carefully this song called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, and I really can't say that I felt in love with it, far from it. But it is just a matter of taste, because the song is obviously a good quality one. &quot;Home Improvement&quot; has kind of a rocky-folk rhythm and a rather soft and nostalgic melody. Josh Woodward has a pleasant, sweat and clear voice, but as for me I find the song too soppy, and a little bit boring.

      I'm little concerned about the future. My first concern is the ecology: more companies in developing world like in China or India use a lots of traitements moreover as we are more and more in the world we need more food so raise the production of food which means more and more pesticide. The second is for the job market, if in the future we will have robots, It will do everything instead life people! The workers will disappear so the rate of unemployment will increase indeed!

      I think that TV is very violent in my country and there are too many commercials. In fact we can't see a program more than thirty minutes before an advertisement. I understand that TV needs funds to finance their TV shows but it's very boring to often have a break. Then, the TV is more and more violent. Every day, there are scientist movies with a lot of murder and violent scenes. Children doesn't have to watch program like that. Parental control is not enough, we have to find solutions.

Our boss told me that in a few month I'll get a promotion which is to be the manager of the team. It's weird, I'm not totally happy because many of our colleagues wanted to get this promotion more than me and I don't think I'm the best one to succeed to our current manager.

      The first picture predicts a future collision between the Earth and an astoid which is believed to be the cause of human beings' extinction. This is called Apocalypse, which is said to happen in December 2012,the ending day. Like the hypothesis for Dinosaurs, this one is believed to create at the same time earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tsunamis, wildfires, espeacially a great climate change that people can not get over and survive. The second picture represents a failure in resolving European's financial problems. Euro will be no more the common currency. There will be a change in Europe, either a new currency will be created, or Europeans will use US dollars. Whatever happens, it will be disastrous. The third picture with the Green Earth surrounded by the garbage represents a serious problem of discarding waste. Failure in recycling and in educating people's awareness of how negative waste influence our lives will lead to excessive pollution, unstoppable animal exctinction, and finally, incurable Earth destruction.

      My opinion for the french TV, I think that there are too of channel and sometime I don't know what choice. I also feel strongly that there are too many stupidity at watch as the reality show or channels entertainment. The children love that but they learn anything and become silly, that this affect in school and the results are down. But also, the violence is too present on the TV with the movies, the information unlike the sex that is better framed. He should to have more restriction channels with the CSA for that the children watch thing more intelligent.

      Checkers is a kind of board game. This is a game that is played by two. Each player places his pawns on dark squares. Pawns move on the diagonal, the player at the opponent. They move only one square at a time except when there is a decision When a box next to the diagonal is occupied by a pawn of opponent, and there is a free space behind the pawn can be skipped. When all your pieces are in the opposite space or there remains no pieces for the opponent, you win.

      I just heard the song &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward who is a live-wire acoustic rock musician from Ohio. This song has an incredibly catching melody. This is a type of music that I am addicted to. The singer's voice is really edgy and the lyrics are not offensive at all but rather sentimental and sad. Because of the quick beat, you really want to dance to it and hit the notes with the singer. Now I can't get it out of my head !! Anyway, you should listen to it because the tune is pretty catchy. I promise, you will have a great time.

      Last month Justin Bieber was arrested in Miami, Florida, because he was driving under influence. Medical tests have detected both drug and alcohol traces. It is not the first time the famous Canadian singer was arrested in the US for DUI but this time he seemed to go too far and the Canadian authorities look quite embarrassed and don't know what to do concerning the budding star. Another Felony to add to a long list of misdemeanour events which occurred all over the last summer and a controversial music tour in South America. Even the Canadian themselves don't want anymore to support and defend the temperamental boyish singer and they raised a petition asking that the green card delivered to the starlet by the US government be revoked. Now we can say for sure that the ball is in Justin's court and it's up to him to make amends for his childish behaviour and grow up.

      Last week, I ate in a small restaurant in the downtown of my city, Strasbourg, France. The place is very small and not quiet at the lunch time, because it's a take-away restaurant too. The reason why I choose it is that it offers Mediterranean food. All recipes were colourful, flavoured and tasteful like in the South of France. They were served in small portions in order you can have a lot of them, from the appetizer to the dessert, without feeling too heavy at the end of the meal. What is interesting too in this concept is that it is a deli too where you can buy all of the typical ingredients of the dishes. And with the loyalty card, you can invite your friends to discover it or offer them some food gifts like a carton of amarena cherries or a bottle of balsamic vinegar. Finally, this restaurant is the place to go to discover the Mediterranean food step by step, firstly at the table of the restaurant and endly by cooking at home.

      In France - that's my country - we benefit in a lot of vacations, 30 days, more or less. But the work-life balance depends on everyone. We have to work approximately 39 hours a week but sometimes we have to do more to finish a task. These extra-hours are paid for technicians, give or take, but generally not for managers. This time organisation generates conflicts for people who are very catchy by their schedule and sometimes there are strikes. I think it may be two demonstrations, or so, a month at Paris. But at my office, it is peaceful ; it's a pretty casual environnement with friendly colleagues. We work about 45 hours a week for a great social cause. So I enjoy it.

      What is a successful person? I can't make a complete and global definition. It depends of to many things.Some people believe that success and money are linked, while others consider that a successful person is a person who can help the others, everyone have his definition of success. But i am going to give you few aspects which are to me, the most important to be a successful person. In my mind, a successful person have inevitably to be motivated and passionated, because it is really hard to succeed in general and it necessite sacrifice. In the way of success you have to fail few times and learn obout your failure. A person who is not motivated, determinated or passionated will give up rapidly by discouragement. A successful person have to be competitive to because they are often other person who want the same thing than you and unfortunatly everybody can't succeed, it leads to an hard human competition. To me, a successful person is a person who follow and realize his dreams. And who is happy in his life.

      Today, we have  lot of channels with the cable tv. You can see very interesting programs but also very silly ones such as reality shows. I think there's a lot of violence. In France, we have even special channels about murders, crimes. If a kid or a fragil person  sees these programs, it could be very shocking for them.  I agree with the tv rating but I' m not sure about its efficiency. People like to overpass the forbidden things ! So, we have to be very attentive to what children see and we have to discuss with them about it.

      Hello Tim, Let's review our last needs. So you ask for 30 laptops and 15 tablets. We can't go higher than 30 000 euros. Thanks to our wonderful negotiator we aim a total bill of 28 500. To clarify, the laptops cost 800 euros each and the tablets are at 300 each. It is really less that what was predicted. Also the service plan contains parts and labor for two years. We can extend it for two years more by paying 2 000 euros. That would be a good solution for being not worried about informatics. You have to take the final decision about the purchase, and also for the payment process. Thank you to prevent us early enough as we can write up the contrat and obtain the equipment before the last headline. Regards, Bertie

      Hi Ian, I just heard about your decision to resign from Stoward Bank. Sarah mentioned you are leaving because of a phobia triggered by the relocation. I also suffered from claustrophobia so I can understand what you feel. My symptoms included anxiety, sweating and panic attacks. I used to avoid long train journey and stick close to exit doors at parties. If I spotted that an exit was closed, it would often be enough to trigger an attack. I would recommend you visit your doctor and ask for advice. I would also suggest you practice some relaxation techniques. These can really help in times of panic and anxiety. Good luck! Don't hesitate to call me if you need to talk. See ya, Sophie

      I really think it's impossible to think about the future being totally optimistic or totally pessimistic. It depends of the place you take to look forward ! I'm optimistic about my own life because I live in Europe, in peace, I'm healthy and relatively rich, but I'm pessimistic about my children's and grandchildren's future when I think about the so bad condition in which my generation's people are passing the world and earth to them, got into debt, pollution....Always getting more power, more money, more technology are nowadays many people's ways of live. I hope that future generations will change for more respect, more solidarity and more sharing out.

      My girlfriend Anais and I recently ate at a restaurant, which is near my house. It was an Indian restaurant called &quot;Le Palais du Raja&quot;. The employees, an old man and an old woman, were very nice. The food was also very delicious but not low-fat. We ordered Indian specialities as Pakora (Potatoes donut) in appetizer or Chicken curry, baked in a Tandoori oven. Moreover, the place looked great and very authentic. In fact, typical Indian items and stuff were hung on the wall. Finally, this restaurant was not expensive with about 8 euros for an appetizer and a main course. &quot;Le Palais du Raja&quot; was an excellent restaurant, that is why we will probably go again.

He quickly took a raincoat and digged a trench around the tent because the rain was stronger and ran under the bedrooms and into the tent.

Have you ever compared your wage with the wage of male colleagues? Is there a difference? Do you have children? If yes, did you take a maternity leave? How long? What did your manager think of that? Have you heard about the Sex Discrimination Act? Do you thinck this law is necessary? Why do you think so? Have you ever brought a discimination claim? When and why?

Obviously, it's often a long fight, (but nothing is easy) The new laws protect environnement, permit the web development in the deep country and ,of course, permit to supervise elderly people for exemple , to keep in touch and so.....

      The three paintings which will be exhibited in the museum can be described as follows :1. The Impressionist Wing is a reaction to traditional, overly-formal styles of painting. In this painting, the effect of natural light is studied by impressionists. The featured painting are the Road Bridge at Argenteuil by Claude Monet in 1874. It was painted on-site and shows boats on the River Seine.2. The Expressionist Wing is organized by two -groups of German Painters: The Bridge and The Blue Riders. The artist liked painting horses with bold colors experimented and tried to capture the primitive energy of animals .3. The Cubist Wing is inspired by Picasso and Braque in Paris. The geometrical forms are used and shows multiple viewpoints of one figure. Some colors like green, gray and brown are used and the objects are fragmented .

Living cost progressively increases, housing budget literally exploded, my insurance and my motorcycle's mortgage as well. I had to borrow some money to my mother, which wasn't easy as I consider myself as independent. I also had to change the way I managed my finances, and start from a scratch my new monthly budget. But, thanks to that, I could keep a roof over my head, and food on the table. Now, things are turning around, and I'm saving money.

I have seen one of his films , I found that he was an excellent actor. The Winner will be a movie to forget. Roy Craig is an actor who made a bad choice. For once, the critics are not wrong. The rumors tells he Has been well paid. Jenny

      Today, there are more and more health and safety regulations than when I was a child. It's definitely fine that law keeps people safe, but I wonder how we had done before all these rules were introduced. Despite the lack of them when I was young, I'm still alive. My friends and I used to play soccer in the street, climb trees to build huts or take our bicycle to go to school. All of us are safe and sound today because we were warned against dangers by our parents. Does the law stand in for our parents? Does it become our parents? I hope no!

      Hi Mary, Do you remember my  dream to ride at the next TEVIS CUP in the USA? An American rider contacted me for offering a horse. I don't believe it myself! I'm like upon a cloud. I'm so excited. I would never have thought that it was possible that my dream is being realized. Please, promise you won't  tell anyone!?  Some riders could be jealous. Please keep our secret because for the moment nothing is done. Indeed I need to check all the expenses before to confirm my venue. I'll let you know soon. Take care. Jim

      Jocelyne has arrived in the company two years ago. She is a project manager. She has immediately impressed us with her strong knowledge in IT and her ability to do several things toguether, even if sometimes, it is irritating because we can not always follow his reasoning. She has already passed the following problem while we are still trying to understand how we will resolve the last. She is very competent and be always careful not to offend us.

      Dear Sir, I am writing regarding the overtime I am due . I had to work extra hours during two weekends and I object that you refuse to pay this overtime. My contract clearly states that I should be compensated for my weekend work. Furthermore, you argue that these extra hours weren't your fault, this argument can't be considered as nothing in my contract allows you to refuse to pay me for something the company is not responsible of.  Consequently I believe I am within my rights to claim being paid for the two weekends I had to work. Should you refuse to pay, I would consider the possibility of suing the company for damages. I hope there is an opportunity to settle out of court. Yours sincerely MAP

      This song is very catchy, with a really addictive beat. It make me feel a huge desire of rock dance and I can't get it out of my mind. The accoustic guitar gives to the melody a Country style with a certain range in the melody. The piano and drums have a Pop impact. Jode Woodwaard is able to hit high notes, giving to the song a sentimental and nostalgic mood. The lyrics reflect his personnal implication in his song, with a touch of his soul. I think this song could be very popular and a lot of people'll enjoy it.

There were seven different burgers and nothing else. They comes with french fries or coleslaw, don't ask for anything else. For dessert, you can choose between cheese cake and... cheese cake! As I have written, it's very simple. It's really delicious too. It's made by a chef who cooks in front of you. Even though burgers are not an original French meal, after this so delicious meal I had, I must say that French street food exists yet!

Moreover he gets by with the body language. He showed us dozens of charts and tried to explain us their meanings. Another thing he did well was to motivate each person who was present. We all left the meeting hopefully. On the other and, one thing he could have done differently was to talk about real problems. Actually he didn't want to talk about every topic. People would have been more satisfied if he had given the unemployment figures. He contented himself with saying &quot;things are looking up&quot;. I'd have liked him to have been more honest. I'm still not sure if I'm gonna vote for him. To conclude I would say that the presentation could have been better, but it was ok.

      Dear Sandra, I've had what I think is a good idea for a new addition to our product range. The details are below: Title: Endangered and extinct animals.  There a different levels of endangered animals so the pack could be sorted into these levels. Therefore, customers could play sorting games with them or games such as Happy Families. Environmental issues are very popular currently, so I think there would be a good market for this topic. Costs should be similar to Animals of the African Continent as we would be able to reuse many photos rather than paying for a picture of a dodo, the most famous of extinct animals, there are probably out of copyright pictures available.  If you would like to meet and discuss my suggestion, I would be happy to do so. Also, as I have had considerable experience on the American pack and also the Animals of the Americas project, I would be very keen on editing this new pack.  Best regards...

      I remember when I growing up, I liked reading anything : newspaper; novels; travel magazines; and my favorite, historical fiction. At the time, books was printed exclusively on paper. So, it was necessary to move in library or bookshop in order to procure things to read. What the pride I felt at having on my shelves all the books I'd read. In the past, every day, all the membres of my family watched black and white TV together. We couldn't choose our program because there was a single channel. One day in the 1985s, my parents decided to buy a color TV. What delight to have this modern device. In the same time, I was pretty sad to give up our old TV. Somewhere along the way, Internet became more and more an important communication media. So, I've started to read news online with my laptop. Now, thanks to my Kindle, I can read absolutely anything I like into it. In my opinion, this new technology make reading even more relaxing. In conclusion, an e-reader is important to me for one reason: I can carry lots of books on one small device. Unlike digital media, a large space is required with paper media.%%

What is really weird is that they decide to celebrate the event and to organize a &quot;divorce party&quot; like another wedding ceremony... I refuse to attend it ! Maybe, she'll wear her wedding dress again and their guests will throw some rice at the exit of the court. This is a bad joke, isn't it ?

      I live right next to Paris, in Vincennes, France. It's just across a wood from Paris. Life is prettty expensive, because there're many shops, clothes stores, restaurants, coffe shops and others delicious food shops like bakeries, tea shops... All you need to spend much money. There's a theater and a movie downtown. Subway and bus get you to the center of Paris in fives minutes. There're a lot of parks and a castle which is very attractive specialy for English tourists. In sunny days, people from Paris get here and Vincennes is crowded, but it's exciting, too. All activities and sports can be done in the neighborhood. Well, life is pretty nice here. That's why I work hard every day... See you there soon.

Outside the weather was very bad : much wind and much rain, no light and all trees was fallen on the houses or on the floor. One tree was fallen on our house but we had no damage. We were lucky but it was a scary evening.

      I don't like baseball, but 'Moneyball' was a very interesting movie. The story is a little dark. You learn some dreadful things about sports, but 'Moneyball' has a happy ending. 'Moneyball' is about the Oakland A's general manager, the famous Billy Beane. Beane wasn't given much money. He had to get creative. Billy Beane was played by Brad Pitt, and 'Moneyball' was directed by Bennett Miller. I think that actors always do a good job when they work with Bennett Miller.

      Last week, I went at a french restaurant with my boyfriend. I didn't want appetizers, just a main course. I ordered some meat. I asked for medium rare cooking. With this, I asked for mashed potatoes and green salad with oil and vinegar dressing. It think it was not organic salad neither local product. Usually I prefer organic product and eating fresh vegetables. Maybe we have to find some vegetarian restaurants to eat this kind of food. My boyfriend took a dessert. He chose a fruit tart. For me, it was just a espresso. The server was really nice but he was interrupting us every time. So, it was not a good adress !

      I understand laws about tobacco and alcohol. I reckon that the State must care for the health of the citizens. However, unlike drugs, the State makes a lot of money with the trade of alcohol and tobacco. And it's why, from my point of view,  the laws are sometimes ridiculous. Here in France, as far as tobacco goes, for example, all the cigarette boxes have to show a notice reading in bold letters that smoking kills, and they must also wear a picture about the damages caused to health by tobacco. Do you think that the addicted smokers look at these warnings ? From an economical point of view, since 75% of the price of a box are taxes, what would happen if every smoker gave up tomorrow ? Non smoking would kill the State, yes ? And where would France go with no more wine drinkers ? Nevertheless, a law obliges any person on the radio or TV, who only pronounces a word like &quot;wine&quot; or &quot;beer&quot;, to immediately add &quot;to be used moderately, of course&quot;.It sounds slightly childish, doesn't it ? And do you think that such an advice would prevent any drunkard from having a shot too many ? I don't think so.%%..

I have a computer at home and every day I could take one or two hours for my studies. We can study all the aspects, for example: - Writing with the grammar problem, Speaking, Listening, Understanding I like the methode. Furthermore one being regularly noted we see its progress and the study rank is good for competition. For these various reasons I am interested in your curriculum.

However I've had the phone fore a month now. and i can honestly say i don't know what to do without it , I've become dependent on it , i use it to keep in touch by text, phone and email with my family and friends, I'm able to access the internet when i need news or social website like facebook or twitter . And i love to take pictures.One big advantage is that the phone has a built in camera . I can take picture immediately send it to friends/ Well maybe i'm having only problem is the battery doesn't last so long and i have to repair it if it has problem

      Darling, At the moment I'm thinking about my professional development and also my future in general. I realize I am very interested by my studies and I would like to learn even more by travelling around the world. That's why I was applying for an erasmus exchange for the Oslo University.  If I was accepted, I know it would be difficult for us because we would be far. I didn't reflect to a solution but I'm convinced it's possible. I'm looking forward to seeing you again. Love, Caroline

      In my country,we have strict laws about the street's cleaniless.For exemple, If you smoke while you're walking in the street and you throw your cigarette on it, you can have a fine if the police is seeing you. I think the law is strict because, in the past , the Streets were become very dirty. Also, when you walk your dog, you have to collect your dog's excrements and put them on the trash can. I understand why we have to do that because if we let the excrements on the street , it won't smell very good.

      In France there are a lot of rules about everything. The conduct policy are very specific. Speed limits are stupids, the rules were decided so many years ago. When the cars weren't safe. It's not allowed to drive with too alcohol in the bloodstream, this rule  is logical, there still are too many accidents on the roads of France related to alcohol. You can also lose your driver's license. Or maybe go to jail if the infraction is major. All rules aren't not adapted for our time, but I think most are important for our safe, otherwise the world would be much dangerous.

      Dear Sir or Madam,  I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to open a mortgage in order to buy the house I am currently living in.  I believe that it will be cheaper for me to buy than to rent in the long run. Not only will I also benefit from the property building equity, but I would also benefit from the stability of owning my own home and the freedom to make changes when needed.  Please find enclosed a budget outline including my income, expenses and savings per month. As you will be able to see, my finances should allow me to buy the house. I am currently paying $800 rent per month and believe I have an adequate income in order to afford the mortgage payments. In addition, I deposit $380 into a high interest savings account monthly which can also count towards paying back the loan.%% This amounts to a total of $1180 that I will have in order to pay off the loan.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need more information. You can contact me at xxx@gmail.com or ### ### ###. I look forward to hearing from you.  Yours sincerely, Me

      When I was growing up, I read books printed on paper. I'd read anything  graphic novels; autobiographies; nature magazines; and my favorite, crime fiction. Somewhere along the way, I've transitioned from paper to electronic media. In the early 2000s, I read my first e-book. It was a 1930s classic: 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' written by Zora Neale Hurston, written before digital communications media was even born. Now, I read my novels and news on a tablet. I do research for work on search engines, blogs, magazines and online dictionaries .I've noticed some huge differences in my habits, too. With paper media, I would use my fingers to turn a page; with electronic media, I tap or swipe my screen to go to the next page. Sometimes news articles contain links. I can tap the link and be taken to an entirely new world of information. In fact, I do a different finger dance made from a complex series of taps and swipes to accomplish certain goals. None of this was possible with paper books and, frankly, sometimes all this digital interaction can become a little distracting. In all, however, I enjoy it.

He asked me to follow him at his office and after looked his laptop he offered me 10% of discunt. I was very happy of this nice gesture and in my run-up I asked him a second year of garantee.

      We all think a lot about effective and innovative ways to prevent and solve business problems. I'd like to toss around a few ideas and perhaps propose some additional management strategies for some of the specific issues we're experiencing. I'm sure that we're all very familiar with Albert Humphrey's SWOT analysis, the management-strategy process where managers evaluate a project's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). In order to encourage expansion, I think we need to develop a greater feeling of mutual trust between employees and managers. What I'm proposing is that we be willing to allow employees to take on greater responsibility; we should be willing to allow them to make more decisions. The more we can trust our employees to perform certain tasks without supervision, the more upper management can devote to expansion and profit strategies.

      I'm familiar with a number of technology because of my work in an IT company. So, I depend on my smartphone for everything : news, weather, booking, purchase, .. I remember when I got my first laptop at work in 2006. I couldn't imagine how much it was changed my life. It was great I could access all the programs I needed from anywhere. But sometimes, It was so complicated I had to check the instructions every time I used it. The best change for my life have been when my company have allowed me to work every day from home. It was awesome. I didn't have to get ready in the morning, and there was no commute. Unfortunately, with the passage of time, I realized that I have been trapped. Consequently, I haven't balance between my personal life and my work anymore. Although technology have some downsides, I don't know if I can work without it.

      Concerning the future, i'm rather optimistic about some subjects. First, for all concerning technology, communications.. it seems that there will be a big revolution. New ways to communicate (video teleconferencing, phone teleconferencing..) which will reduce the cost of travel for companies. Those advances in technology could concern other sectors like health, education... it's another way to view the future. At the contrary, i'm so pessimistic about the environment. Nowadays a lot of countries have fewer laws about it, the consequences are serious : the animals doesn't have food anymore, the weather is totally reversed, people have more diseases... It will be a disaster if we can do nothing about the environment protection.

      Mark the 'bowling alley', an 8x3 meters area. Fill the 'bowling pins', plastic bottles with water to make them heavier. Line up the bottles in rows of 4, then 3, then 2, then 1 - just like ten-pin bowling.Give each players a frisbee. Shoot twice on each turn and give each player a total of ten turns.Scores as much as pins he knocks down.Get two more shots if you score a 'strike' (you knock down all the bottles). Win if you get the most points.Be careful not to play this game on a very windy day!

      What makes a successful leader is hard to define. Take ma, for example. Most of my adult life I was more of a follower than a leader. i 've always had a hard time persuading others, and I lack most of tre characteristics that we associate whith a stringer leader, like charisma and drive. It wasn't until five years ago, when I was hired by a new company and ended up in a management training course, that things began to change for me. At first, I thought I would never be able to develop leadership qualities. Among the biggest challenges for me was just feeling comfortable in front of a large group. But the leader of the course earned my trust and, before I knew it, I was being asked to help others. Now I'm the manager of my departement, and my boss is very happy with my performance. I don't think I'm the best leader in the world, but my staff reepects me and I feel confident. The most important thing that i've learned is this : never underestimate yourself.

But, I'm writting you to try to convince you not to resign. I've read that there are a number of treatments and techniques dealing with you problem and you'll probably be amused by the improvement you'd make. First, you've something called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which is a kind of psychological methods with a positive views on yours fears; Also, you've some medications which could help you to cope with your Claustrophobia.

      Donnie Darko directed by Richard Kelly is definitely a must-see movie ! Before his not very convincing 'The Box' based on the Richard Matheson's novel, he had conceived an unsung masterpiece. First screened incognito, it finally received a deserved acclaim once released on DVD. The great strength of the movie : mixing the genres swimmingly. We believe we are watching a thriller with a young schizophrenic inclined to murders whereas we are caught in a Gothic one. Stylized horror movie for few shots  besides, the action takes place on Halloween  while we attend to a genre movie, certainly, but a SF one. More than a mash-up, a combination of many elements or a borrowing to one genre or another, Kelly plays with frontiers. The movie becomes more than a meta-genre, it's a 'borderline' object. Beyond the psychoanalytic approach  although widely present  the word has to be taken at face value. The movie is in a perpetual balance, close to a rubbishy one because of the human sized rabbit's intervention, hero alter ego, related to his urges and came straight out of a B movie. Kelly draw his inspiration from this shared imagery and clichs which take the audience aback and make the surprise possible. Kelly transcends them. Indeed, he frees himself from frontiers to build something else. We are at the heart of the subject : the movie talks about human boundaries and getting over it, physically and mentally. Unsuspected capacities and self-denial. If you liked 'The Butterfly Effect', we would become familiar with his father : 'Donnie Darko'.

      I don't know how will be the future, but I want to believe that it will be great, that all people in the world will not die of hunger.  In my opinion Africa is the future, african countries have the most important development potential. The new technologies development will improve our everyday life. However, all of these progresses will not make without pollution control.

      I attended a meeting the previous week. The points on the agenda were to talk about a possible merger of the company with one another, which was in another town. The CEO started by saying we should arrange a meeting with the board of our partners, in order to discuss about changes and such subjects. The CFO disagreed and suggested we should see with our executives the exact situation of our budget before. The COO argued we were running out of time, so it wasn't possible.They finally agree to arrange a meeting this week.

      My husband and I wanted to celebrate his birthday in a very good and unusual restaurant. We called to make our reservations and the employee told us we wouldn't have the choice of our menu, it would be a surprise and probably with some unknown flavors for us. This restaurant is very famous for that. We arrived at 8 p.m. as recommended, in a really beautiful and relaxing place. The lights was soft and pleasant. They just asked for the ingredients we didn't like . The dishes were prepared in a new way and really exquisite. The plates were so nice that we took many pictures. It was unbelievable. We loved this restaurant and probably will go again.

      We have to admit that most of human beings are not born with leadership skills. Everyone has not the potential to be a leader. We can observe leadership skills or not of each others every day in our life. When we meet some people to do something together, there is always somebody who speaks first. Usually that person will conduct the group to find the best way to realize what they want to do. Personally I always have been a leader. When we arrived in our village, immediately I became the president of pupils' parents. When our children left the primary school, I have become the president of a twinning commitee. To be a leader, I think empathic and others. Your vision must be clear and precise to earn honesty are both the strongest strengths you must have. Once you have those qualities, you have to develop them by hardworking and by sharing your vision to people's trust. There is nothing most important how what you say. You need to be enthusiasm to get people enthusiastic; you need to commit yourself to get people committed.

      When its about talking about renewable energy, my country seems always to be absent. Indeed our politicians think that we have bigger problems to deal with, like economic crisis. In my opinion all, if we make the good choice, renewable energy could be a trigger to our economy. I know that the first solution we have in mind for renewable energy is solar energy. Although it has a lot of advantages, he has one of the worse inconvenience: a high installation costs. So if we want to install solar energy, we shall invest a lot of money. For a country like ours it is a high brake. As far as Im concerned, I think we should choose a renewable energy like biomass. In fact biomass is relatively low cost and it just requires forest residue. Like you know we have a lot of forest. The government should just use his power to collect and reuse all forest residue in order to generate biomass.

Not because my parents won't buy me one but because I don't need it. I am a bit afraid with all those new apps and games. It becomes rare to not see someone using its smartphone during family dinner. Is it right or wrong? I don't know. There is a point I can't deny, our way of life is changing, faster. Now it is crucial to be in the move, not left behind, and it is even more important in professional career. People have to keep connected, to be faster and faster reactive. Until what extend?

      The new law in France for last summer says that it's prohibited to smoke in public places like bars, restaurants, bus stations, community transports etc... It's became as a felony to smoke where it's prohibited and the sentence could be a big fine or even 5 years to prison. My point of view is that I'm in favor of this new law. Healthly, this law protects people who  don't smoke and for addicts, they have specific places for it. But something annoys me very much: when I go take the metro at the station I always see people who smokes their cigarette. And it's the same case at all public places where it's prohibited. I think the police is not strict wich people who violate this rule. The police officers should do more rounds in public places and I'm sure they should get people who smokes in. I've a lot of friends who smoke and when I invit them at home, I impose them don't to smoke in my appartment. That's my rule. If they want to violate the gorvernment's rule that's their problem, but my rule in my appartment they have to observe it.%%

      Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to enquire about the possibility of requesting a loan. I would like to buy with my wife the house I am currently renting. I trully believe that buying a home is more economical than renting a home in the long run. Indeed we could both benefit from property building equity and from property taxes. Moreover owing a home will give us the stability, the independence and the freedom our couple is really looking for. Please find enclosed a budget outline including our income, expenses and savings. As you will be able to see, we have decent income but most important we invest money every month in a saving account and we put aside money for emergency. Moreover our spendings are limited and we monitor our budget very closely. This amounts to a total of USD 1180 that I will have in order to pay the loan off .%% Do no hesitate to contact me if you need more information. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,

      Goodmorning everyone, If you vote me for the student council president, I'm sure our school is the best place to learn and to play. You'll get good studying scores and have a good health. First thing I will do as a president is learning conditions. I'll intervene to have smaller classrooms with better equippements. A new flexible studying plan is suitable for everyone, who wants to study full-time or who wants to get a part-time job. Second thing, our heath condition. The price for coffee and canteen food is cheaper but the quality is better. There are more options for field sports and outdoor activities. A fund will be raised to build a gym center and a swimming pool. As it is said that we can not be intelligent in a poor weak body, i will do my best for our good student life. Last but not least, the sanity conditions will be improved, no more dirty toilets is for sure. I'm Angelia Vince, please remember to vote for me as president, Angelia Vince. Thank you very much.

I returned to ask chef the name of the person who order the dinner. It was my neighbor !  the chief was wrong the address! What a mistake! he was so awkward and my neighbor so upset and me I laught of this storry yet ! !.

      There is a fair amount of risks to starting a new business. The most important thing that you can do to make your business successful, is to make sure you have a plan. A business plan will make sure that you are clear on what is it that you are trying to accomplish, and how you are planning to do it. This will keep you focused, and ensure that you don't get sidetracked. It is a good idea to go back and look at your business plan from time to time, to see how closely you are following it. A second key to having a successful business, is that you have to know what is it that you are selling. What you have to know is what makes your product different from your competitors, and why a customer would want your product. This brings us to the next key to business success, which is having an effective market plan. The biggest challenge for most companies is finding customers, so you have to make sure that you have a place for doing it. If you can find enough customers everything else should be pretty easy

There is always the same beat in the song, It can be boring even annoying. Josh's voice is edgy, he has a limited range but he hits some high notes in particular for the undersong. Mood of the song? I'm a little confused. If I listen only the beat, this song is kind of happy with a fast beat. However, the lyrics sound sad and sentimental. Interesting but not exceptional, It's a nice song, you should listen it at least once.

      Compared to other countries, France has always been rather late in adopting gender equality as a goal and designing policies to achieve it. But is it still a topical issue or has France caught up ? Through the decades, men and women havent always been treated on a equal footing. Step by step mentalities began to evolve and, during the year 1944, French women obtained the right to vote. In the 60s, the women went down the streeet to demonstrate and as an answer to their struggle to obtain equal rights, the Abortion Act was voted in 1979. Besides the evolution of women in society, they still earn 20% less than men for doing the same job. Indeed, women are discriminated as they have to reconcile family life and work. Its high time things were done to improve gender equality at work! On the other hand, we feel time has changed: young couples share the chores more than ever and dont men also claim their rights to look after their children ?

Then, I arrived on the homepage of the site, I think that there were too much information and advertising but there was a bar on the top with all the different categories of product. Therefore, it was really quick and easy to find the selection of exhibitions even though the sheer volume of colorful information. I appreciated the page dedicated to the art performances because the site gave us a sort by success and according to the favorable opinions of previous buyers. So I could read the recommendations of people which confirmed my choice. After, I clicked on the thumbnail on the right of the picture of the exhibition I wanted to see and I found the buying page with my shopping cart. I had to select the number of tickets. Then I had to choose a mean of payment. I chose the credit card mean because I knew that the pay-pal system was really secure.%% At the end I got a summary email of my purchase and I could print directly my tickets at home so It was really convenient!

      At Blue Cruise Alaska.I'm reading a complain about your next cruise. It is the worse package tour of my Life.First, the cabine was dirty and bed incomfortable.Shame on you! The crew, particulary the captain was unfriendly and unprofesionnal.So, talk about money now, all was not included !!!Your advertising is misleading.And where were the animals?We've never seen one, only eagles. My friend cruise experience has been different, everything was really included, they have sailing on a new ship (not like us).Cabines were more comfortable.And everything was included in a price even the insurance.

      I'm amazed at how the TV shows are silly in my country. We have a lot of soap operas and reality shows every day on all channels. Unfortunately we don't have the rating system. It makes complex to control what our children are watching. In my opinion, we need to remove many stupid shows and to create more educational programs. I think also that in everyday news we have too negative topics. For example, we talk every evening about a property of our politicians, poverty of French people and economic crisis in Europe. I'm not keen on it. I feel strongly that we need to talk more about the future of our children and to try to develop some interesting educational programs for them.

      Hello Ian!I know you have many symptoms and I definitively know the reason : you are claustrophobic. I just finished to read a leaflet about this. The symptoms are exactly the same as yours : anxiety, panic, an urge to look for ways out for psychological symptoms and breathing problems, racing heart, sweating and shaking for physical symptoms.I don't think that it's a good thing to quit your current job. You love it! And there are many treatments and techniques for dealing with claustrophobia. You can try the meditation and the relaxation for exemple. It's really important to make small steps and gradually. you can talk with a psychologist. I think that will be great for you.I will bring you the leaflet next week.Have a nice week-end!Emilie

      In my country, classes take place in a room, which is big enough. The instructor or teacher writes the notes on the board. the trend is in my time: The courses began at 8 a.m, if there were any latecomer, they had to wait for the next course. I'm not really in favor in using tablet or online courses. they can not replace a person, and also the fact to get up every day in the morning make the courses should be given by a teacher. most schools are trying to adopt the new policy. By ten years there won't be any teacher at school. So, I think this kind of education will suit you, because you're a fan of new technology.

The pollution constitutes an immediate danger for the health, but also has an effect which increases over the years.

      Actually, I'm not very optimistic about the future mainly about the environment and pollution. Despite all the progress in new technologies, like wind and solar energy, this new &quot;clean energy&quot; still more expensive than gasoline. That why, the developping countries, who need a lot of energy to grow and improve their economy, will not use this pricey energy.  Ther is still a lot of work for our scientists and long negociations for our politiciens to find a real solution.

      Since White Space was commissioned, by the Mishima Corporation, to design and construct the Sun Tower financial complex in Japan, it appears that the knives are being sharpened. It has been said this morning, that shares of White Space Associate have dropped. The reason would be that our company wasn't up to the challenge. We deny these slanderous reports. White Space beat out 100 others companies to build Mishima Corporation's new HQ in Tokyo and Mr Mishima himself approved of our design. He chose our company - our mission statement of creating harmonious and efficent buildings using all that modern technologycould offer. M Mishima stated that our design fulfilled our own criteria 'beautifully and exquisitely'. Charles Lewis [CEO of Better Homes] should be sure of his facts before making such outrageous and incendiary claims. If his intention was to infect our team with uncertainty then his strategy has backfired in a spectacular fashion. Our advice to Better Homes is this: stick to what you do best. Meanwhile White Space will continue to do what we do best, building for the future.

      We have a lot of farmers in my country. We also have a lot of wolves. From a social point of view, I think it's safe to say that farmers and wolves don't get along. Wolves kill farmers' animals, and so farmers kill wolves.  Wolves are endangered now, which means there aren't a lot of them left. So the government made a new law that it's illegal to kill a wolf. From an environmental point of view, the law is probably a good idea, but what about the farmers? If a farmer shoots a wolf now, he's a criminal. He has to pay a fine, or he might even go to prison. To my mind, that's not fair. The farmers have rights, too. If you ask me, making laws is a complicated business, and as many people as possible need to be involved. There has to be a way that makes everybody happy. Maybe the farmers could get compensation if one of their farm animals is killed? Maybe the local authority could send in people to catch the wolf so the farmer didn't have to kill it? Whatever the solution is, let's hope it suits both farmers and wolves.%%

      Dear Sir For obtained your sponsorship I must explain which of the two exams will be the better. That's why, some words about the differencies between Toeic and Toefl. The format is the same in the two exams, 200 multiple-choice questions for the Toeic and 140 multiple-choices for the Toefl. The first point to make would be that Toeic is for eveluates your Englis proficiency in tine global workplace while Toefl for academic studies. Accordingly the Toeic is used by compagnies to make decisions about recruiting, promoting, and deploying employees overseas. Compared Toefl is used by the schools as a placement test. Secundly it is logical that is not for the same people. The Toeic is more appropriate than Toefl for employees in international corporations and voice effects Toefl is more applicable for the students. It is for this reason, more than any other, we couldn't promote any exam or other. An exam by public, we must conserved these differences. Best Regards, Bob

      I think that Shawshank Redemption is the last movie that I have watched and enjoyed.The nature of history of the movie was very original combining a sense of injustice and a great plan of escape. This movie try to show us how someone can be victim of injustice and can succeed despite of very bad conditions in prison life. But the important thing that this movie reveals, in my opinion, is the possibility for justice to make a great errors of judgments and how it can destroys sometimes the life of someone who is not guilty. This movie was also a big success because the actors were really fantastic and had played their role perfectly .

      Are gender differences still one of the favorite topic of conversation in France?  Of course!  When it comes to communication, that main subject never be out of fashion!  Even if many French women usually work, be in politics or are involved in many fields of the society, the very well-known gender equality is probably condemned to stay like an inaccessible dream.  At the moment, I would like to say that it's easier to be a man than a woman in my country.  In 2013, why men still earn more than women?  Shouldn't women get equal pay for equal work?  In spite of a great evolution of the society, women are first considered as potential mothers.  Then, they can be recognized as effective hard-workers who can easily fit many different jobs.  Shouldn't  men be a bit afraid of women?

I don't like sailing, its not exciting enough for me, but i can play football because it's too funny. I can't play any musical instruments but i'd like to learn. I also like play video games.

      Words rule the language. To improve my vocabulary I have a method in 4 points: - I use regularly graded readers. With them, I can learn new words and I can understand without too much difficulties. I have tried to read &quot;The grapes of wrath&quot; of Steinbeck, but it's too difficult. Even in French, it would be difficult for me, I think! - I also do some &quot;narrow reading&quot; with 3 or 4 magazine articles on the same topic: it helps me with collocations. - I practice loud reading in order to memorize the words: it works well with me. - I watch the news on English TV: BBC and France 24 English. Even if it's yet not easy, I know it's a good way to learn useful English words. And with my work in EnglishTown school, I hope I'll be able to graduate before the end of the year!

      I would like to speak about my french people with their finances in general. Actually in France, there is people who like keeping their money for themselves, without any purchase, but there is also and mainly, people who spend a lot of money without any consideration of their own source of income. That's why people, step by step and month after month, getting strapped and even broke. What a mess. Buying clothes for their identity or for their vanity is the silliest thing ever like buying a lot of video games to escape responsability and real life instead of assuming issues. Don't use money like an escape, just think about the others instead of thinking about yourself

      So far, I have never worked in an office, because I am still student. But I have had some overview thanks to some internships I made. I think that in France we have a pretty good work-life balance. Perhaps too well, regarding some countries as the USA where people work a lot. French people may be seen as lazy by the other countries, I think. But, even if we don't work a lot regarding another countries, we are quite productive.  As far as I am concerned, I am glad not to spend lot of time at work. It allows to make some sport, relax, and discover other things than those related to work.

      Unfortunately i never did any extreme sports. Not because i'm afraid, but only because i never thought about it. But after your English Town exercise about extreme sport, i would like to try skydiving. The sensational feeling coming from the movie characters was strong. Feeling like you're someone invincible, seeing your life flashing, enjoying your landscape and getting the adrenaline before and during the skydiving, all these sensations put on me some interest about extreme sport. But if i can't to that, my second option could be white water rafting. It's very thrilling and at least, in my area, i could find much place to do that.

      I have listened the song wich is called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. The singer is Josh Woodward. He is a folk singer. The melody is very classic. I have the impression that i've already heard this song a lot of times even if it's the first time. The voice is pleasant but the song is very long. I don't know when this song have been writing but it seems like a song of seventies. I thank you for having me discover this singer but i don't thing that i will  go on the internet to hear others songs to him, i don't like these kind of songs, I prefer punk music.

      In the Cameroon , the trend is to give tests to students at the end of each lesson. I'm all for these tests because  they oblige the student to learn every day . But i'm against  surprise tests because  it is not  normal for a teacher to make  surprise tests , there is often many subjects at school, teacher must program their tests on schedule. It's unusual to see older people  come back to college although they need it. I'm not surprised , in my country  people think  that  enjoy a  new career, means  you have not loved your previous career. In my opinion we must change this behaviour.

      A few days ago, I went to the restaurant with 5 friends of me. We went to a restaurant called &quot;Les enfants terribles&quot; and localized in Paris. The food was quite good. However, I think that it was not fresh or organic food because when my friend ask the question to the waiter, he firstly looks embarrassed before he told her &quot;yes, of course&quot;. We took a dessert. There were a lot of choices at our table : cheesecakes, crepes, tarts. When dessert arrived, we could saw that it was an industrial production.

      The office culture where I work is informal and very friendly. There are two persons who work in the office: two managers of the art gallery. We have a good relationship. Sometimes, we go out together to dinner of for drinks after work. We work 40 hours a week, more or less, and take a real vacation once in a year. It's about 2-3 weeks. I don't have to wear the formal dresses. Otherwise, my collegue, has to, because the men in the art galleries often wear costumes. Unfortunately, we can't close the gallery during lunchtime, so we need buy something to eat and stay in the office. Sometimes, it's a little annoying because when the sun shinning you have got to stay at work between 1 and 2 p.m.

      Hey, I fine and you?I respect your desire to silence that's why I'm writing this as you are not obliged to respond. I would like to show you how I see the situation, maybe it will help you there.I find your reaction now really exaggerated and I weigh my words. Indeed I do not see what is wrong: it seemed natural to separate myself a moment of a person who ached for me, and know that I did not want that especially Leah to tell you, quite the contrary , however I could not, being your best friend, ask him not to tell you, that's all.I wanted to see if you relied come to me, even me if I did not come. Apparently this did not tell you much since you marked me as just wanted. This reaction, I find it selfish because you made me suffer much more in recent weeks. Now I feel that this whole friendship was a bluff, that you did not comply by not complying with my desire to put me away for a few moments: I need this moment to too strong to break this link which united my mind to yours and could destroy it.I think you have not understood something big for my intentions, and that your current behavior is a formal proof. If you prefer to maintain this silence I do not understand the course, but know that I am not a man who agrees with every whim. I adore you, of course, but apparently my feelings FRIENDLY, you do not respect them more.Now I expect you to show me I'm wrong, apparently I did not understand much about me either.Another thing, I feel that you also wanted me because I drew closer to your best friend. If this impression is true, then think ahead and you will see that it is terribly absurd and that anyway it is now dedicated to you as I was. Also I try never to go up against you, first because of myself, I would not ever come to mind, because then I have no reason to do: I do not follow you Conversely, far from it and if there is now a camp You and Me camp, it was you who built them.If this letter is a bit dry is to show you how to talk to you and I miss how I'm frustrated to see the reaction that I do not understand. If you do not want to talk to me again too bad for me, but I never know why, it's not necessarily a good solution.If you do not do you give me reason and when we must talk, which will eventually happen, will not necessarily be pleasant for both of us. I understand however, that thou wouldst hide in you ease and not talk to me, but after such a letter, do not ask me to believe that you need time to think.Thank you for reading this.Emma

She certainly didn't mean to offend you and to be impolite. Although I'm not looking to give her excuses, I did want to explain her reasons for putting her foot in it. It's just that money is not a taboo topic in her country. On the contrary, it's very polite to show your hosts that you noticed how wealthy they were. Selma didn't know that it was very inappropriate. I promise that she will never overstep the mark again. Once again, please do accept my sincere apologies. With best wishes MAP

That's why I've waited, and after this week end, I've lost her, I've only had her first name, and no one who knew her in my friend, in order to friend her on facebook. But a day, looking a photo of a friend of mine, I saw a girl, and below her name, I saw a high school, and I knew that The girl was there. Therefore I refound her, and after numbers of tchat and calling discussion, I met her again. She was, she is and she will be the one

      Inspector Adamberg arrived on the crime scene twenty minutes after he had been called. The night had fallen three hours ago and now the large luxurious house looked like a haunted manor. As he entered into the house, inspector Adamberg saw the victim, an old man wearing rich clothes, laying down on the carpet, in a pool of blood. &quot;John Berley, the famous oil tycoon&quot;, said a police officer. The tycoon had an horrible hole on his forehead, from where blood had spread out. Near his right hand, a jewel-encrusted dagger was lying on the floor. &quot;Probably the murder weapon&quot;, thought Adamberg. &quot;Berley was very rich, he had a lot of enemies. Money could probably be the motive of the murder&quot;, said the police officer. Suddenly, a door cracked and somebody ran away from the room. &quot;We are not alone. The murderer may still be here...&quot;, said Adamberg.

      When I was young, to keep myself informed about the news, I had three possibilities: read the newspapers, watch television or listen to the radio. The most common way was watching TV because we had both: the informations and the images of the events. But, since the early 2000s, a new genre of media appears: Internet. At first, it was like the newspapers, we only had informations and some pictures to illustrate them; but as time went by, as the internet network improved, so today we can watch the news online at any time, and everywhere. In fact, tablets, e-readers and smartphones are more and more widespread, so it's easier to read a book while commuting or while we are in a waiting room. Digital media has taken a huge place in our life, it's still improving every year, so I wouldn't be surprised if, unfortunately, someday the former mass media like newspapers would disappear.

      Good evening to everyone. I am really pleased that you're all come tonight to celebrate the wedding of my brother Antoine and Coralie. My name is Brice and as you all may know I am the little brother and the groom Antoine. I'd like to offer a toast to this wonderful couple. To begin, I'd like to share a story with you about my brother Antoine. When we were kids and also older he always told me that he will never get married to a girl. He insisted to me that a wedding is not necessary to prove your love. Coralie I guess you're happy that he changes his mind about wedding.(little joke) I am really happy that you decide to marry my brother, you're truly a humble, honest and beautiful person and I hope that you will stay with my brother for a very very long time. On that, let's toast to the health, happiness and future of this beautiful couple and to my future nephew. To Antoine and Coralie!

      In my country, it exist a lot of channels, so we have the choice to watch entertainment or documentary for exemple. However, I'm amazed about the expansion of the reality shows. Almost all young people are addicted to this kind of genre and they find it's the real life. Even if the channels are varied, the programms are quite the same in the most famous channels. There are a lot of americain soap operas or series. An other problem for me is the commercials. It's annoying. I can't stand the breaks during the films. Fortunately, of the public channels there are no more commercials past 8 in the evening.

      I think all that gossiping gives me an amazing feeling; I wonder if both people magazines and celebrities are in a deal to make money!

But it's also quite difficult to understand who wants or needs to throw the rumor.

      My compagny is in trouble because of its management technique. Basically the communication between the manager and the employee is really poor and company's results are starting to decline. The solution that we found is to organise a dinner  or  an event every week in each team  to create a social link stronger than just a professional relation. The other possibility would have been to change all of our management method. For now results are comming and communication starts to improve.

      We have free national channels and paying channels. On free channels, programs are often poor, repetitive and not very interisting, we can see a lot of old U.S. police series, a lot of blood, many murders! Comercials are very importants. The pay TV programs are much more interesting, they have the advantage of having spcificities: Sport, cars, nature, flora, fauna, recent movies etc .... You only have to choose the nice programs. In my opignon, the French TV is very interresting and programs are diverse when you can to pay.

      Hi, John. Here's a summary over the weekly meeting. It was a very short meeting. We didn't have time to get bored. First, Chap told us once again to be ready to engage affairs. Then, Boubou summarized quickly the last HSE committee. Giff asked us to prepare the logistic committee for next week. He wanted us to give him our charts on friday. I really appriciated we'd had time to ask questions at the end. On the other hand, the meeting began late. As usual, Chap hadn't given us the agenda. I would have prefered that he had spoken loudly. When the other speakers were speaking, Chap had often been interupting them avoiding them to end their sentences. Finally, I think, we had better not to meet. We'd better to send emails and meet each another to answer the questions remaining. I hope I will never drive a meeting like that.

      Communication in my country is generally indirect. By that I mean people don't like to make very direct statements for fear of offending or upsetting others. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings. You have to become skilled at reading between the lines to understand what someone is really trying to say. Along with this indirect style of communication, goes a rather formal use of body language. People in my country don't make a lot of gestures while speaking. One gesture we do often use is the thumbs-up; that means 'great' or 'ok', which I think is the same everywhere. In some countries, it's common to put a hand on another's shoulder, or even hug, but that kind of behevior makes people feel uncomfortable in my country. You need to have known someone a long time before there's any physical contact. The best advice I could give to someone visiting my country is, when first meeting someone, to hold back a bit. Watch what other people do, and listen a lot. Rather than ask a lot questions, wait to be asked questions. And, like I said, try not to be too physical in your interactions.%%

The first thing is that you must thrust to others; You have to give your ideas; they will all be analysed intern and evaluated. If the teamsignals a good idea which can help the company to win some money, this team will be recompensed by a price like a check. For new projects, we'll carry out a SWOT  analys before his beginning. Every body will be involved. If somebody has a problem or even another idea, we'l be happy to study it. So we'll be stronger and even more competitiv. We have to work together if we want to have a place on the new word market.

      Hi kids, Listen to me for instructions. The area marked here is the bowling alley. At the end, I have lined up 10 plastic bottles in rows. The aim of the game is to knock down the bottles with the frisbee. The first player shoots two times and marks a point by bottle knocked down. If he scores a strike, he marks 10 points and plays again (2 shots). Then it is the turn of the second player. Each player can play 10 times. The winner is the player with the most of points after the ten turns.

      Right now,  I'm in High School,thus, I don't have any job career. However, if we consider babysiting as a job then I've been doing that some months earlier. My plans for the future ? Well after High School I hope I'll be able to go to an American University so that subsequently I could work in America and perhaps I could be a movie translator ! Nevertheless, money is a big trouble as studying in the USA is really expensive, that's why prior to that I would like to go to England and work as an au pair girl so that I could take care of children, take English classes and be paid. While in England, I would keep money aside as much as I can and improve my English in order to be able to study overseas. It's only been a year or two since. I really wanted to study aboard, prior to that I wanted to study where I live, in France then get a licence in LEA which is about English and Spanish and afterwards I would work as a movie translator in France ir someplace else.

      I had an accident last month when I played soccer with my friends during the P.E lesson. I was running slowly when I saw the ball. Directly, I speeded up to catch the ball but unfortunaly I fell on the ground, my right leg hurt me... My teacher called the ambulance because the pain was to strong! When I was in the hospital a doctor came to see me and to try to find if my leg was broken. But no it didn't! Finally I had to stay at home for two weeks before I could go back to school.

      Dear John, I visited Canada last year and I allow myself to recommend severals advices for your trip in this beautiful country. You have to avoid to yell down to a friend in the street. Don't go alone outside in the night, it may be dangerous. And above all don't smoke anywhere near people. It's very important to visit someone with a little gift for him. In store office it's bad to push ahead of others for service. Have a good stay in Canada and don't hesitate to contact me if you need anything. Yours , Patrice

      It happened end of Summer 1989. We were sailing along Corsica with my brother and 4 of his friends. At the end of a 2 weeks  cruise we had to sail back. On our way to Toulon, we had our turn to keep the watch and I got on the deck with my partner in the middle of the night. Then we saw a spectacle I hadn't imagine to watch ever. The storm was strong, the waves so high, we felt we were sailing through buildings and couldn't see beyond 1 miles  away. First I was frightened but then I couldn't think anymore.

      &quot;War is declared&quot; is the second full-length movie by the french filmmaker and actress Valrie Donzelli and is based on her own story. This war is not set between nations or any other enemies with guns and bombs but this war is a fight against illness. From the moment when Adam's parents learn that their young son has got a brain cancer until his complete recovery, the life of the three turns to a military battle where weapons are replaced by the efficiency of love and parenthood. It could have been a melodramatic topic with lot of tears, this is a missile of positive energy and a dive into the world of the Parisian hospitals. Filmed in a unique personal style that could remind the creative liberty of some Franois Truffaut's New Wave films, &quot;War is declared&quot; is also carried away by an extraordinary soundtrack including some hits like &quot;O Superman&quot; by Laurie Anderson or &quot;Winter&quot; from the Four seasons of Vivaldi. The movie has been selected by the French to be proposed for the Oscars.

      I think that if people make efforts, the future will be more interesting than what we can imagine. For me, in one hand it's important to have a very different idea of the future and not to be pessimistic. On the other hand, all ways must be use for the future's development. Actually, i'm optimistic about the future because we can see that many ways are using by Europe, American, Asia but also by Africa to have the best future. For example, countries are developing laws for the nature's protection. It 's a very good think which proove that people can be optimistic.

      I have learnt that it was a bad habit to postpone every time. If you have a task lasting less than five minutes, you must tell yourself : just do it now! Otherwise, try to make a planning and respect it. Not following this must triggers organization problems and not quiet self-consciousness. You must keep learning in a complex world : it can enable you to avoid mistakes, to be more efficient in your working and everyday life. You benefit from huge sources of information : Internet, books, TV Its important to do all your best to remain healthy.  In order to feel in a good shape and to avoid diseases, its better to eat sane food, not smoking and practicing sport. Its good to create yourself big projects, goals, challenges and remain always optimistic in order to advance in the life.

The police were told she had not intended to seriously hurt her husband when they started arguing about her plans to launch a lunch-delivery business. The police were also told Mrs. Nelson had suffered frequent verbal and physical abuse from her husband. On the night of the stabbing, Mr. Nelson was sitting on a stool in the kitchen of the couple's home. Mrs Nelson pointed out to the police that it was he who started the argument, not her. Serena Nelson moved toward her hubsand, intending to slap him to stop him shouting, but her husband just laughed. It was then that she picked up the knife, wich she had been using to make the sandwiches. Mrs. Nelson turned toward her hubsband, holding the knife. The knife, wich had an eight-and-a-half-inch blade, entered his chest. Mrs.Nelson was said to have been 'hystorical' while dialing the emergency services.

      About this subject, the very first that I thought, was Facebook. Facebook the social network, or the place to be, to tchat, to live our life or a second, a third one. Thanks to this website, people seems to forget the essential, seems to forget how speaking with someone without using mail, or mail. Nevertheless, facebook has affected my life forever, because of it, I found old friend that I had lost, and also my sweet honeymoon who is sharing my life since 2 years now. Without facebook, I would have never see her again. What a site. Notwithstanding its bad aspects, its such voyeurism but it could create miracle sometimes. Facebook is a complete part of the new technology, it is everywhere, on smartphone, tablets, laptop, TV.

      I recently attended a presentation about our company new procedures. It lasted about an hour, but I didn't find it too long. Indeed, the speaker was clear and easy to understand. His speech was told in a conversational manner, so it was quite lively and not at all monotonous. Furthermore, he used a lot of visual aids which were very accurate and helpful to have a better comprehension of what he was saying. Another thing he did well, was to summarize his key points in the conclusion. We were allowed to ask questions at the very end and he handled them well. The answers were clear, indeed. On the other hand, I would have liked it if he had given more explanations for the additional services. Another thing he could have done differently was to allow us to ask questions during the presentation, in order to keep our attention. Overall, the presentation was useful and given in a professional way.

      There is a big number of big-box stores which have been created since a few decades. For instance, on my island, namely Corsica, there are four big-box stores just for Bastia, a small city on the North of the Island. I think such stores have both positive and negative effects on communities. Concerning the pros, such stores can provide a wide range of products at a price more interesting than those proposed by a little supermarket. Therefore people can afford more things and have more choice. They can buy a lot of things more quickly. Nowadays, the big-box stores also propose the delivery of the products directly at home for free. So, it's really convenient when you are busy. However, at the same time, big-box stores shows cons. First of all, local family-owned businesses often go to bust and go bankrupt because they can't keep up with the competition of the big-box stores. Their prices are too attractive. Secondly, the workers of the big stores get very low wages and they don't benefit from social and health advantages. Nevertheless with the economic crisis I keep thinking that it's always a good thing to have a big-box store around the corner.%% I would like to point out that it allows community to create new jobs and revitalize the economy even though such model of store presents some drawbacks previously mentioned.

Then with no understanding reason the train stopped suddenly the driver used his brakes fiercely, all of us in the middle felt,many were scared some screamed, others got a fit of giggles the situation was awkward but also funny, anybody was hurt just few bruises, and dust on clothes. Most of the people in the middle of the carriage were teenagers, students. Once up the train started again, the driver apologizes and said through his microphone the problem was because a fire on the tracks. We arrive to the terminus 20 minutes later all in good shape.

      Business' aim is to make money not to help people. Helping the most disadvantaged is the job of volunteerbut managers look for having a company's good image .  Corporate social responsibility impacts the environment, consumers, employees and communities. Companies like to donate to society .Obviously solely biggest companies who earn a lot of money can give back a part of theit benefice if shareholders are like - minded with this idea. For example, company can give money in the field of sport and quite a few support local soccer's team. I don't believe they like to helping local community. If they do that, it's,  what you call, a good marketing trick! For business sense, they think if young people like soccer, young people will like the company support the soccer's team. It's just a publicity stunt and the aim is to earn much more money yet. It was nothing more than!

The car was having smoke over the hood and she couldn't manage to open it while she was soaked. I suggested her tow it to the nearest garage. The day after, she called me to say thank you and I asked her out. Our first date was restaurant and movie. Everything was fine and we could get along with each other.

      In my opinion, watching tv is not the better way for educate. In my country, there is a lot of violence, a lot of scene not good for childrens. More than, they are behind the screen during a long time without mooving. But in another side, tv give us an image of the world, shows something we cannot to see in our lifes. And i really like animation program because its very funny and entertaining. When you dont feeling well watching tv changes minds... So i think the kids can watch tv but we have to impose restrictions on them.

      Hello Aunt, First, don't worry and try to enjoy your trip! Now, I am going to answer at your questions. So, an e-ticket is a ticket that you have to print at home with your printer. You also need to take your identity papers. Perhaps you will have to complete a formulary in the plane. Dont hesitate to ask questions at the flight attendant if you feel lost. I wish you a good trip.

      When I was younger, I experienced a hurricane. For the young girl whom I was , that was a mean to not go to school. Hurricane warnings were announced for several days by tv and radio. Most of people were ready because this phenomenon is common in the West Indies. In fact, they were preparing its arrival in storing water, non-perishable food and candles. When Hurricane warnings were finally upgraded, it was approaching in the night. Everyone has barricaded itself at home. The wind was blowing so hard that could uproot a tree. Heavy rainfalls have caused floods and landslides.It was like hell. No one was killed in the disaster, but many houses were flooded. I'll never forget it.

      I saw &quot;Twilight 4&quot;, is a movie in two parts. My preference goes to the second one. &quot;Twilight&quot; is about a vampire and werewolf story. It's also a love story between Bella (a girl) and Edward (a vampire). There is also Jacob (Bella's best friend and Edward's best enemy). Jacob is also a werewolf : he loves Bella but Bella loves Edward. Bella and Edward have a baby : Renesemee. Jacob realizes that he loves the baby more the mother (Bella). The only problem is that babies born from that sort of parents grow very fast and become adult in seven years.

      In France there are no classes on Wednesdays for pupils. So kids can have a break in the middle of the week, which is very important for their productivity, and they have their time to do other artivities outside the school. But recently, the french Government decided to do a reform of school system, and to add classes Wednesdays in the morning. Parents and teachers are against this reform, because children are very tired and have not any improvement. In my opinion, this reform is not a good one, because education must be adapted to kids' captivities and if they are tired and not productive, there is no reason to increase the classe hours.

      On social occasions, the first thing you have to do is to be dressed properly: never too much, but in the appropriate way to the event: no fancy dress at a formal lunch for example, and no sneakers at a cocktail. You also have to show interest to your hosts and their guests by asking polite questions on what they are doing in life, think about some topics of discussion, use diplomacy if something hurt you or doesn't correspond to your opinion. Do ever show interest to someone else wife or husband. Never ever. ANd it is not appropriate to ask for a phone number, give your business card and wait the person in front of you to give you his or her. Don't ask for it. It is also rude to speak like if there were no one else in the room: your private life and discussion don't interest everybody!

      There a lot of different opinions about criminality in France actually.A lot of criminal activity links with drug dealing. One of this point of view that drug addicts need to be treated,cared for and encouraged to break the cycle of addiction-they don't need to be criminalised.But we need to take account of the fact illicit drugs markets are dynamic and the wider issue is not about light drugs(e.g. marijuana)-Class A drugs.Issues like cannabis farms and new psychoactive drugs also create social harms and attract organised criminality.On the other side opponents say that alcohol was responsible for not less crime and health problems than the illicit drug trade.Drug addiction costs a fortune,but it pales in comparaison to the depredation of alcohol problems. Drug policy is not working in France,we are not reducing the supply-we need a full debate on how to take this further.I hope that practical policy measures might be more persuasive than big-picture philosophising.

      In my country, France, there are a lot of rules about driving. In France the driving licence is with point. Everyone had 12 points, except the young driver they have 6 points, and when you dont respect the laws, you pay a fine and you loose point. I think it's too much, it's a double punishment. the hardest sanction it's about driving and drinking alcohol, but for me this rule is great, because in France there are a lot of accidents caused by drinking and driving. My friend says it's not dangerous to drive if your are drinking, but I think it's not true, with alcohol it's difficult to make attention, and it's not just dangerous for themselves.

      This year we decided to buy tablet-computers for our salers. So we had to negociate that with Stella from Micronet. We needed 300 units with 64 Mo. Stella's preliminary offer was $500 per unit. It was so expensive that we thought to change our idea. Then I told her that we probably will have to change most of our computers next year, and we could choose her company if their prices and service plan was satisfying !! So her second offer was $45O per unit. It was still to much for us.... I decided to make a counteroffer to $380 and insisted on the fact it wasn't possible for us to go higher. Finaly, she checked with her boss and we had an agreement to that price with a standard service plan for two years, all parts and labor. We were delivered two months later. It was a good deal.

      I never thought the smartphone will affect my life so much. First of all, it's amizing, you don't need to be at the office all the day : people can reach you wherever you are and you can answer or not. You can also listen to music, artists or play list as you want. From several months it's possible to use it as a 3G card wich is very interesting when you travel. I'd been reading newspapers before I bought my smartphone and know I just have to download the information. It's realy powerful, it's impossible to mention all the applications you can use ... a true revolution !

      Of course there is still a big gender inequality in my country (France). Even if it's far from being the worst there is still a big effort to do. My country is really attached to tradition value and we are kind of conservative. Thanks god, it's changing but, as far as i'm concern, not fast enough. In the other hand, i might be too much in hurry, if we consider the presence of women in education. Indeed, we may say that women and men are equal in education just for 10-20 years. We still notice around 70% of men in engineers school. (Note for the corrector : please check with attention the wording and the orthography, thank you)

      Is 40 years old ? From my point of view it's not, but I just have to look backward and to talk about my childhood with some kids and suddenly I feel like a dinosaur. Quite everything now is same as in the world I use to live in when I was a kid ; quite everything ? Except perhaps the media. As far as media is concerned, everything has changed several times in the last four decades. Growing up, I was listening music on records ; then appeared tapes, and after CD's, and now most of the time we just have to download it from the Internet. In the '70s, the only screen was the black &amp; white one of the TV. Now, our world is full of screens : computers, tablets, smartphone, and soon even on glasses or watches ; we can find screens everywhere. 40 years ago, we were connected to our family, friends,neighbors and colleagues ; now we are connected to the World. That change has a name : it's called Media !

      Do still exist gender differences in Gabon? The answer could be yes. Over the years, roles haven't really changed. Men always see women such as the person which caters to the needs of the family. The latters are supposed to take care of children, to clean the house and to cook. Men prefer to keep their wifes at home. Women have tried to change this view. Most of them work today and foster equal rights. In fourty years time, a lot of women had gained access to important positions especially in politics. Unfortunetaly, the men outlook didn't change at all. The main problem is the contradiction between Gabonese traditions and modernity. In fact, women want to live freely or to keep the control of their life but the burden of the society and the traditions stop their actions. May be, in few years, we will have founded the perfect balance between men and women roles.

      I met a man who sleeped in the streets. I passed in front of him each day and I had immediatly seen that he was ''different''. He tried to be clean and worthy and he didn't beg. One day I chatted a bit with him. Two years ago he worked as an estate agent but as everywhere in the world the bottom dropped out of the housing market. His agency went bankrupt. . For a while he earned a small unemployment benefit, then he used his savings to pay the rent and bills but now he hadn't any money left so he had to go away from his apartment. Since the first day he's tried to find another job without success but he didn't lose his self-confidence. One day I didn't meet him. I heard he picked up a work. So he could get a place in a social hotel. I was happy to hear that things were looking up.

      At work, one of my colleague is a financial manager. Sometimes, he is bad tempered , a little bit rude and agressive with his subalterns. As a result, many of them criticize him all the time. But, on the contrary, he has many strengths. Indeed, he's very self confident when he negociates contracts, when he makes presentations at meetings. He is funny, sociable and very clever with figures. He hates to be disappointed by his subalterns. For example, when someone arrive later, he becomes very angry and can be very nasty with him. So, be careful with him. Work and work !

      In the future, i think that we'll have more environnemental problems to resolve because most of the world has been needing energies to grow up, and many &quot;new development countries&quot; don't matter about ecology. The problem comes from industrial countries which haven't been representing good examples for them to decrease the polluate energies ( gasoline - coal...). Another reason to be pessimistic for the future is the incredible grown up of the world population. For the next century, I 'm not sure that we 'll offer meal for everyone on earth ... except industrial and chimical food ... what's a program !

      In November 2013, when my daughter was in the Philippines, a huge typhoon struck over Tacloban. Luckily, all people in the area where she was were evacuated before the typhoon occured. She's never experienced anything like that before .She thought she was going to be seriously hurted.She said that it was crazy, awful. The sky became very dark.Many big and thick clouds flought over them.The wind was likely been stronger (300 km/h).The waves hit the beach with incredible force .She was terrified. On the coast, houses mostly made in wood and sheets were picked and thrown across the beach; it was a disaster. Currently when she thinks about this natural disaster, she is still affected. She sees the beautiful area, people enjoying themselves on the sand and...then... this strong wind, this enormous wave wich all distroyed with incredible force, and nothing to do ...just remain calm, calm,...It makes her very sad just to think about it.

      Hello everybody, It's the season for colds and flus, and I always have many remedies and recipes for various problems. I give you some example: - When you have a sore throat, you could drink a spoonful of honey and ginger. You cut some ginger to put it in the honey. And take a spoonful of it. - Garlic crushed with lemon and acerola is very great for your immune system. It's easy to make this mixture. - You can put a hot mixture of vinegar, olive oil, and eucalyptus on aches and pains. Drink it and you feel good after that. Thank you to read me.

      What's the difference between TOEIC and TOEFL? The first point to make would be that they are both test proficiency in English. On the one hand TOEIC is used above all by employers, but on the other hand, that also can be used by school as a placement test, especially for business-oriented students. Secondly, employees who want to get an overseas job take TOEIC, whereas students take TOEFL. You have to take in consideration that the second one is not only the realm of studies, but also a good way to get a scholarship for exchange programs. Therefore, to be more precise, TOEIC is English test for work, whereas TOEFL is English test for academic studies. However, both require a high-level in English. These are just the biggest differences between TOEIC and TOEFL. Consequently, ready to make your choice? As far I'm concerned, the more suitable for me would be TOEIC. Why did I choose this one? Basically, because my studies are far away from me now. At the same time, I'm hopeful that one day I could live overseas...so, why not?

      Blue Cruise Alaska If I were you, I would complain about this trip. Between you and me if you have the chance of meeting Mr. Blacklist, Assistant of the Manager, tell him you are furious and claim the reimbursement without delay. Sir, Alaska is maybe a land of extremes but I could see that how easy is to go from one extreme to the other; The ship wasn't new and wasn't a cruise ship: in fact it was a horrible shabby little boat; the cabin was dirty, the beds were uncomfortable, the bathrooms very disgusting (insects) instead of a cosy and comfortable cruise vessel! The captain was unfriendly and unprofessional: he woke up late and had a lot of problems with his engines instead of being attentive to our needs and ensure that we have a smooth and exciting trip. In fact it was a real nightmare ! and that's not all : due to those incidents we didn't see what we paid for, 'the dazzling array of wild animals' but a lot of ants in our cabins ! Finally, I must say that we had to support extra charges even if our package included all expends.......

Each of 2 players has 1 King, 1 Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 2 Rooks and 8 pawns.Each of these pieces moves in a different way. The aim of the game is the capture of the opponent's King. When King is attacked by opponent's piece or pawn, he is in check. But his capture is not possible, contrary to the other pieces. The King must get away. If it is not possible, the game is lost. He is checkmate and the game is over.

      &quot;Home Improvement&quot; is a pleasant, enjoyable song singing by the singer-songwriter Josh Woodward. The song is nostalgic but under the sad lyrics, &quot;Home improvement&quot; is a protest song about America's consumer society. This song is simple, with just an instrument : one guitar and one singer. Just the two of them to talk about changes of a country. The singer choose a simple and lively way to say how he feels since money lead the country without being too sad, just nostalgic. &quot;Home Improvement&quot; is not all fans' tastes but is very close to reality and deserves to be listening.

      Nowadays economic situation in France is very difficult for some people. Finally, there's a big contrast between people. Some of them are loaded than others are completely broke. When you have a good job, life is easier and you can pay out your mortgage, have a good medical insurance. You can afford to buy a car and take holidays. But if you are jobless or you are working for a little compagny with no benefits at all, managing our finances is a tough task. Moreover monthly expenses like rent, utilities, medical insurance, income taxe are going up every year. So finally people are strapped for cash and fight each month to keep a roof over their family's head. For these people, it's very hard to make both ends meet.

But I remember that was a small tornado the 26 December 2009. The tornado moved from west to east of all the country and continued in Germany. I heard the wind that was terrified. And near the house, it was a forest. I was going out to see the trees uprooted . I had never heard this sound before that was awful. My daughter was a baby and in the house there wasnt electricity.

      Internet has been changing deeply the way we live and interact, especially since social network technology was introduced. By using social nextwork, people can get not only news, but also private update about their relatives living faraway. One of the most important things that make this possible is the capability to interact in real time. News travels faster and faster. Howerver, addiction to social network is a big concern we must pay attention to. There are people who just log in and out of their account on Facebook more than ten times a day. They check their news before going to bed or even in bed. That affects their ability to concentrate which easily turns into having attention disorder. So it's time to rethink the way we use social network.

Water ran wherever, in the streets, the houses, the basements, the backyards... People, scared, had to go up on the upper floors waiting firefighters and others emergency services or rescue workers.

      I have a friend who is always successful. She is a former colleague of mine. She seems to reach every goals she had define. I admire her because she is a self-made woman. Her parents where not wealthy nor influent. However she worked hard and joined a famous high school. Then, after being graduated, she was hired by an international audit firm where I met her. I don't know exactly what traits make her so successful but the main reasons I can pinpoint are the following : she is a great listener and has exceptionnal abilities to adapt to every type of individuals. In addition, she has a strong work ethic that endows her with respect. Furthermore, she is very resilient and is always able to bounce back from adversity. For example, when it appeared clearly that she would not be promoted in our company she resigned to create her own audit firm. But from my point of view, what is the most important is that she is incredibly passionate about her work.

The developped countries are too slow to respond. The damage begins to be felt. New technologies may be slower than necessary to prevent an aggravation of the situation. Unless a general awareness occurs globally, the situation will become worse.

      Before NLP: She worked from home and her daughter was also staying at home . She constantly interrupted her so she felt very frustrated at her. She was lacking sleep and so she was acting negatively with her daughter. Techniques applied: First she tries to have a positive attitude. Then she analyses the situation with multiple perceptual positions. She imagine how her daughter was feeling. Then she identifies the negative behaviours. In this case, there was two negative behaviours: one from her and one from her daughter. She searches the positive aspects behind this negative behaviours. She finds out that her daughter wanted more attention. Then she seeks for alternative ways to fulfill the positive intentions behind the negative behaviour.

We don't want layoffs That is why, now , our company is turning towards to strawberries's production genitically-modified .  The advantage is obvious , these strawberries are bigger and more resistant than spanish strawberries . Another advantage , genitically-modified are available all the year .

      the meeting started on monday morning. There were five assistants and their chief assistant. The topic was about discharging an apprentie secretary , named Lisa, of her tasks which were now too many for her, as she obtained new charges now. The chief assistant asked her colleagues what do they think about it and how would they share those tasks nowadays. The discussion turned to a conflict because the main assistant, Evelyne, doesn't understand why Lisa had accepted first to do those tasks and argued that if she had accepted them, she has to go on with them. Lisa told that she was an apprentie and for learning her job she accepted any task she could do to fill her planning, but the goal was to learn the profession and progress were sufficient now. Lisa told that she was asked by a leader to be his own secretary and that she has no time left to fulfill all her job, so it's time to share the work among all the team. Evelyne gave her veto, and the meeting finished by the departure of Lisa, who felt herself unfairly understood, and she left the room, pouring some tears.

      This game is called frisbee bowling. Bottles filled with little water are lined-up in rows of 4, 3, 2 and 1 like ten pin bowling. You stand 8 meters far from the bottle's pin. Each player has 2 shots and ten turns. You should try to score an strike, this means that you knock all the bottles down. If a strike is scored, you get 10 points and one more chance to shot. If not, you get as many points as bottles you knock down. The player with the most points wins!

      Toefl and Toeic are the two famous tests to evaluate one's English proficiency. They share some points in common: the test duration ( about 2 hours), test format ( multiple-choice questions) and 4 skills evaluated ( writing, speaking, listening and reading). For me, as I want to enter medical university in  USA, Toefl is better, for the reasons below:Firstly, Toefl prepares students to obtain  necessary academic English to be able to follow study programs in universities while Toeic is the option for employees, recruiters, or business-oriented students to improve their professional communication.Secondly, when applying for a university in  USA, a student has to prove his English proficiency through Toefl points ranking, most medical universities require 100 Toefl points/120 or more.  more points you get in Toefl, more chances you have to be accepted.Last but not least, as English is a foreign language, a Vietnamese student can have difficulties to understand American culture, history and to catch up with Amecican lifestyle. This kind of knowlege can be obtained through communication with friends, but mainly through books, documentaries which require academic English skills.For all the points I've just presented, Toefl is a must for me.

      Dear Cedric I just heard a Josh Woodward's song who call 'Home improvement'. This song comes to the album 'Here Today' and was written in 2004. It speaks about a guy who loses his house, his job, I mean his life goal because of his town improvement. It's a really good folk rock song with an involving tune and a catchy beat. Josh, the singer, has a sweet voice, and has succeeded to keep a sad and black mood. I think this song show how the singer ha been engaged politicaly and interested in his country. I'm convinced that if you listen to it, you'll fall in love it. I hope to have your opinion soon. Hugo

      I never have experencied any natural disaster. But, of course I have heard about that at the TV. In France alone, there were a few natural disasters recently. Floods, for the most of them. It is due to the season anyway, time is rather wet in this moment.  Many reportings have been broadcast to show us how much the floods has affected people who live in the areas which were hit. Globally, I may be mistaken, but it is as tough the number of natural disasters has been increasing worldwide. An effect of the global warming ? Or, maybe I am just more aware of this issue...

      Is gender equality already established in France ? In appearance, of course it is. Let's start with the business side. In 2013, for the first time government has more women than men. The government tries to be exemplary. Some will say that it's positive discrimination. French's laws oblige the companies to employ an equal number of men and women. In case of failure, the companies which employ more than 500 people, will have to pay a tax. What about familial side ? As we just see, more and more women work and are encourage to work to be independent but how is it organize at home ? In fact, most women are still alone to clean the house and the clothe. In an other hand, our days most men can help to cook or to take care of the children. Things seems to evolute in the good way. Time will do his job !

      The architecture of Paris has a really old story : it is a blend between old and modern architecture. Actually, the Paris urban area is the place where you can find the most important number of skyscrapers in Europe. They are located in three different areas : La Dfense, Italie circus and near from the Seine river. La Dfense is located in the western Paris area and gather the most important part of the French skyscrapers, it is so called the business district, the place where the main and most powerful companies have their offices. Italie circus is a residential district in the South of Paris, less than half a mile away from where I live. The third most important place is located along the Seine river, it is a blend between business and residential buildings. On top of that, there is of course the Eiffel tower, the symbol of France in general and Paris in particular.

It was terrible because lots of people and animals died . It was difficult for the rescue workers to help the Asian becauce roads were destroyed. Charities collected money and food in order to help people. In Asia there is very often earthquakes or tsunami because of the geology of the earth. They use to protect themselve but when it is too violent they can't because it's dangerous. I'm lucky because in France the isn't earthquake.

      Hello everyone, we will give you the review of one of the most popular songs of Josh Woodward. The title of this song is 'Home Improvement'.Josh Woodward uses only his own guitar in order to sing. The lyrics are pretty sad and a bit pessimistic but smooth and enjoyable. Furthermore, the melody is beautiful. I think his song remembers us what happened to people who lost their job and how they could have overcome their situation.To sum up, it's definitely a negative and protest song about America's consumer society. It makes a point about evolving but not improving our lives.

      I heard that you wanted to continue education in France. That sounds like a great idea. One good thing is that you will take only two tests a year. You will also able to get a job to pay for the university. But, don't forget to learn regularly if you want to pass the tests. Now, the trend is to give presentations during classes. I am in favor of it because students learn further when they take part in debates. It is not unusual to complete the education by an internship. So, you should apply for ads before even starting your classes.

      Um, how many people are unemployed in my country? Uh, a lot! Why? Because the bottom dropped out of the financial market and a lot of people lost their job. There are people who don't have enough money for paying the rent or the utilities even for food. The minimum wage is estimated at 160 euros, and in case you have your own home, this money can be used just for paying the electricity,gas and water. Unfortunately, many people are going to work abroad when salaries are much higher. Because things don't seem to be turning around, people are doing sacrifices for their family. Another solution is to borrow money from the bank but the fees are high.

      I think that robots will be able to do a lot of things which can help people (for example housework) and mabbe they will be able to cure illnesses. I hope Africa will develop its trade. I also think that teleconferencing is a very interesting thing; indeed it enables people to communicate and to have a meeting from one country to another. It is a revolution and it enables people to avoid so many trips abroad. I think it is a good thing to work at home since people can organize their private life more easily (with their children for example).

      The French Budget Minister guilty of Tax fraud! (Headline) The French President claims that he didn't know anything about the tax fraud scheme set up by Jerome Cahuzac. (Subhead) The recent scandal revealing that Jr'me Cahuzac, the opinion was deeply shocked, said the Minister of justice, because that disappointing revelation concerns the Minister in charge of the budget and as a result the main person in charge of the control of the tax frauders. The polls have shown that the citizens don't trust their politicians anymore. Eric Meyer, tax lawyer associate at Baker &amp; Mckenzie, claims the hypocritical behavior of the current government, according to him, Francois Hollande couldn't ignore the fraud scheme and as he knew that the scheme was going to be disclosed, he just put Cahuzac as the whipping man.%% Finally, the French authorities are going to strengthen their procedure of control in order to reduce drastically tax fraud.

      One the one hand, I think that it is a good thing to have superstores near your home, because it's useful and helpful, but in other hand  Internet and the superstores kill the small shops. Furthermore, in my area I can prepare my shopping by internet and I have just to pick it up in my car, what is definitely a time saving.  Nowadays, in the megastores they tend to phase out some jobs and replace it by machines what I am definitely against. A lot of people nowadays buy everything by internet because we can compare the price, they offer good services, good guarantee for the product  but after? What if you have a trouble with your purchase? How will you do to return it? The cost of the transportation still expensive, and it can be difficult to package it, if you had throw away the packaging. We have to make a balance between superstores and small shops because it is important to preserve the job  of people, and it is important to speak face to face, if you need some information and advices. Even if you have a huge description of the product by internet, you can't touch it and you can be duped by it.%%

      From reading these two presentations the first website, namely www.nileretail.com is the best. Some arguments: -The usability of the first site is greater than the other. You can quickly found specific genres or rare books while with the other you have to scroll through all of the screens to see what products are being sold. -The product range and quality is better. -The first website offer more payment and delivery options. Furthermore the possibility of getting free delivery is a more significant. -They have a wonderful understanding of customer needs. For example they don't present an usuless product in this season as the other site. -We have lots of useful functionality. For readers have a list of bestseller could be interessant but on the other site no functionality. -For the customer when you call for an information it is important to have an answer but with the second site nobody answered the phone when you called.

      In France, in this day and age, when you are invited for a dinner party, they are some rules and etiquettes. The first one is to reply quickly when you receive an invitation. For the dinner party, we can put beautiful clothes on. Arrive on late is really a bad thing, so please arrive on time. An important thing to do, is to offer a present. For example, a bottle of wine for the man and a flower bouquet for the woman are really good and common presents. During the dinner, please wait all the guests are served before beginning to eat. To avoid the hostess are always alone in the kitchen, you can offer your help too. And, before you leave the house's host,  don't forget to thank them. And, if unfortunately, the good manners are less present today than before, this is really well seen to respect them.

First of all, I have to admire how the presenter outlined our problems, it was really clear, and gave us a complete overview of the companies issues. One other thing he did well was to offer examples for each key point, as well as pie charts, which was extremely helpful to understand exactly were we are. However, I would have liked it if he'd used bigger or less complicated charts. To be honest, it did not really work as it was for such a small presentation. I either wasn't sure about some solutions he suggested at the end. I was expecting something different. But I am convinced he did a great presentation and gave us all the key points to modify our way to work in the future.

He decided to do nothing and he has been sleeping every day for a year. No studying and no working. I was really upset because he was living without goals, usually going out in the night and sleeping all the day. He met a girl and she was really crazzy about him as though he was not confident himself. She'd want to get married and to start a family. She said that he should be liable and find a job to get money. As he does and he came back to school to be graduate. Good work ! I'll let you know what happens. Take care.

      Dear Sir or Madam, I write to you to request the possibility to obtain a loan to open a mortgage. Indeed, for the moment I rent a house for $700 per month. This amount is not too expensive for me but I think that with such a rent, it is possible for me to become the owner of my house. Such a situation will be for me cheaper in the long run and I think that property builds equity. Moreover, I think that buying my own house is like a permanent saving account. For the moment, my wage is near from $2000 and I have no over charge except my rent. So, I think it will be easy for me to become owner and to not depend no longer of a landlord. I am looking forward to read you or to meet you. Sincerely yours, Michael FARTOUKH

      The office culture in France is rather formal. However I work in a music center where people are relax. We can wear jeans and casual shirts. I work with music teachers, composers, sound technicians : 13 people in the office and 30 music teachers, more or less. I'm not friendly with most of them but we go out to dinner twice in a year. Sometimes we are playing music together or we listen to 20 concerts or so a year. Music is our work, most of us work 40 hours a week, give or take. My work-life balance is really hard because I have to play music again at home. One advantage is that we take two months' vacation each year.

      Hi Micheal, I come back to you about the final report on the project 'Heatlhy childs&quot; in Brasil. I met Sam this morning and the deadline change from april 6th to march 28th. I already did the first part (presentation of the overall project and its objectives...) and I'm currently working on the achievements (with statistique table...). I think it would be great if you do the part on the financial reporting. You were in charge of the budgetary monitoring so I guess you've all the required elements in hand to complete it. But, Sam would like us to presente also the financial aspect of our local partners' development. To do so, you need to get in touch with Laura Martinez, our focal point in the NGO &quot;XX&quot;, she can gives you relevant data. I know the timing is short and I'm here to help you if you have any concerns or problems. Anyway I think it would be great to schedule a meeting next week. Let me know when you're free. Have a nice day Micheal and see you soon!

      I have been with my companion since twelve years ago. Stphane and I first met in my cousin's house. It was on July and I was in a friend's wedding. An old friend of mine was importuning me so I decided to talk with an other acquaintance of mine (and my cousin) whose call Virgil. When it was time to go I ask Virgil to see me out because I was afraid that the other old friend followed me. He said me he went to my cousin and I said him:&quot;So did I&quot; ; and it was the truth. When we arrived to my cousin's house, he was having aperitif with Stphane who is Virgil's brother. It's how I first met Stphane.

      I really liked the story about the man coming into a bar. It is a man coming into a bar and asking the bartender a round for everyone, including him. So the bartender gave a drink to everyone and, once finished, the man asked for another round for everyone, including the bartender. So once again the bartender gave a round to everyone and just after having finished this second round the man asked the bartender for a third one. At this point of time the bar tender asked the man to pay before for the first two rounds but the man explained that he had no money and the bartender kick him off. Half an hour later the man came back to the bar and, once in the bar, asked to the bartender around for everyone, except the him, cause he becomes mean when he drinks. I find that story very funny and witty.

This restaurant was built upon the occasion of the Universal Exhibiton in 1900. Forty-one paintings decorate the walls and the ceiling. The dinner was fantastic! First, we ate Scottish smoked wild salmon accompagnied by fresh cream. As the main course, we have savour a farmer's chicken tournedos with mashed artichoke. We have drink a delicious white french wine &quot;Chateauneuf du Pape&quot; and spring water. For the dessert, we have ordered apricot sorbet. Then we have drink a coffee. The check was very high, around 260 euros. Unfortunately, this story is fictional...

      I would like to speak about the twins tower. I had visited them a couple of years and I can perfectly remember how they were so big, urge and of course high. In the maintain entrance you could find a special garden inside the skyscraper. It was very lightened place and when you entered inside you could feel the space with a lot of glasses. It was amazing to feel that in buildings. Even if I visited a lot of Paris and Geneva for many times, I don't think I will be able to find that same feeling. I felt something special. Not only the garden inside but this skyscraper was incredible. I tried to take a picture to the top and the bottom of this building but my camera wasn't be able to do it. Too hight!! Anyway I love so much New York, the atmosphere is really special and all this building higher make you feel as an ant. When I saw the tragedy of those towers on TV, I thought that it couldn't be possible! But believe me, imagine how urge is the plane! How urge were they! I keep at home a clock broken on my wall representing the twin towers!%%

The engine wasn't on a boat, so I couldn't see it working, but he swore that it could, and it looked good, so... I bought it at the high price. One year later the engine is on the boat. but I haven't seen it working yet. It was a very good deal.... for the seller.

First point, the topic was really clear, he described the majors issues, which are the sales decreasing and the possible merger with a competitor. During the presentation, he showed pie charts and tables, especially the sales figures of our company compare with the competition. So, he could made a transition with the second point, the merger. About the conclusion, I regret that he couldn't explain more about the profits that we will expect in the futur with this merger. I think too that he would have speak a little bit louder, some people have been complained that they didn't hear all the comments. But it was a successful presentation, i hope the board executive has been convinced with the necessity of the merger.

      Well, if you come in Paris, I think it's more easier to find evening class to study in the way you want . May be you can try online class but i don't know if it's elaborating. In fact in france the education system is more exclusive. So you have to go to private school and the cost sometimes could be crazy. And more of that you should pass test to prove your skill. Therefore you have to think what you want to study. For me i have learnt to be scriptwriter since a long time. The only cheaper online course i found was in the Canada. In France i found some online course but it was too expensive for. So may be you can take online course in another country.

      Patrick is a very commited person. He wants  succeed and he's ready to work hard to reach the objectives which we have decided together. In my point of view, he is a real asset for the company and could be promoted in the next  years. However, we have to pay attention to his behavior. If he is a good collaborator, he doesn't have a good team spirit at all. Sometimes he's selfish and bossy. His colleagues aren't not at all satisfied to work with him.I think it's important to tell him that he won't succeed on this way and alone. His behavior is clearly his worst weakness. But I think it's possible for him to understand this situation and to do the appropriate efforts.

According to 55%, the accents from the Midlands area of the UK are the most disliked; for the others it's the accents from Liverpool. The favorite accent is standard English for 6 people out of 10 and Scottish for 35%. At last, only 6% think they have no accent whereas 4% have a very strong one; for nearly 3 quarters of the people, their accent is found to be moderated.

      In my country, according the Evain law, it is strictly forbidden to smoke in public places. I smoked since sixteen. I smoked in pubs, in clubs or in restaurants. I smoked in my car but also in my office and now ... I can not imagine that again. Of course it was very difficult for smokers to change their mind and it is still accurate for them. On the other hand from a social point of view they know that it is a good law. Indeed, it is better for the neighboors and the family of the somkers. They can do whatever they want with their health but there is no way with the health of other people. Moreover the law is lenient: you could just be sentenced to pay a fine. Even I was a former smocker I am personnaly convinced that it was a great, great new law. That was a good change.

      Today in the world, we have a serious environment problem. Because of the pollution we have some animals species in danger of extinction or climatic changements which are sometimes dangerous. It is the reason why, in my opinion green business is really important because i believe that it can be one of the best solution to save the earth. The main aspect, in my mind, is energy. We have to use more sustainable energies as solar and wind power and less non renewables energies as fuel or gaz. For example, i have on my roof somes solar panels to produce electricity. A second aspect of the green business really important to me is the consumtion. We need to use more organics feeds avoid to waste. In our life of everyday, we can use recyclable things as paper or towels. We can also sort our trash to permit recyclage. But we need to be carreful, some products aren't really green and we have to informe ourselves.

      Hi Tim, It's a long time since we haven't been in touch actually. I just read your story with a lot of pleasure and fun. Your story made me think about one happened to me a few years ago. A friend of mine, a football player from Bordeaux team, offered me for my birthday in april a ticket to attend a champions league match between Bordeaux and Manchester United. The day before the match I was preparing all necessary when I realized that I couldn't find my identity card to fly to England. Too late to organize and get a valid passport (invalid for 2 years !) but impossible for me not to go to this fabulous match. Finally I took the risk to board in Bordeaux airport with my invalid passport to Manchester but afraid of the arrival with the British customs. During the flight, I could'nt help thinking that I was about to stay in an airport jail and perhaps, with a bit luck, watch the match in the cell...! With a lot of luck I saw that one of the two custom officers was less strict and wasn't opening the passport to look inside. I choose this queue and succeeded in my try, outside the airport I could breathe again.... The match wasn't good for my team Bordeaux but It was a worthy experience to attend a match in Old Trafford. Not a experience as much scary as yours but perhaps It could have been in customs cells..... I'm looking forward to hearing from you Celine

But if not, we fail. After having the baccalaureat (in the end of lycee), we can go to the university, choose our speciality (one or more) and get our master's degree or doctorate or BA. Besides there is other way to learn a speciality : online study or live classes. For the students, the more common is to still at live classes. Online study are more used by workers.

This film was directed by Justin Lin who is a producer very famous of series &quot;Fast and Furious&quot;. Movie's characters were played by the famous actors: Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson or Paul Walker. The story of action film has nothing to say.

As a friend more than a colleague, you really mean a lot to me, that is why I did some research and find solutions to overcome this daily problem which is ruining your life. Claustrophobia is a well known sickness whose symptoms are psychological: feeling of anxiety in enclosed spaces, an urge to find a way out, etc... The symptoms are also physicals like racing heart, sweating and breathing problems. Don't be afraid claustrophobia is not a fatality and there is solution which have proven their efficiency. For exemple, the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy consist to train the patient mind towards a positive and a rational way of thinking in order to overcome stressfull situations. The patient could also used meditation, breathing techniques and relaxation. Medication is used as well to reduce physical symptoms.%% Whenever you want or whenever you will feel ready we can discuss this issue further around a coffee. Take care, Oumou

      I think that the future will be difficult. Indeed, resources are disappearing little by little, and we will be obligate to find others methods to live really soon. On the other hand, the fact that countries always use more and more of that resources is a source of pollution, which destroy our world, and it is going to be difficult for the next generations to live healthy whereas humans exploit the nature at its maximum.  Finally, few courses talk about robots, which is, according to me, another problem for us, they will replace us if we develop them too much.

      Two years ago, I experienced my first hurricane. Of course, tornados warnings were announced but I didn't expected of that. The wind and flood were blowing like crazy, everybody in the countie of pittsburg were closed at home. Then all of  sudden, everything stopped. We were in the eye of hurricane, that's mean in his center. The calm lasted for 30 minutes more and less. And then the wind and flooding started all of again. No one was killed in the disaster but lot of were hospitalized because of injures. I'll never forget it; that was a terrible and fascinating experience.

      In the part France where I stay, disasters are very rare. In others places, they can have flood or wildfire. In the mountains near me there is sometimes a large avalanche which damage a lot. But in summer, we have a lot of storms, with thunderbolts and a lot of rain. Once, more than twenty years ago, it was a big one. And there was a plug in a small river in the mountains. The water couldn't flow down. Then, there was plenty of water and suddenly the water run down. So the river in a few seconds became very high. A lot of cars, caravans, houses were carry away, many persons were killed.

      When I was young I loved fashion, and I knew clothes. Shopping was a hobby for me. I followed the season's trends. I expressed myself through clothes. I'm 57 years old now, and I'd rather wear comfortable clothes. I'm not trendy but casual, and for a special occasion more formal. I'm use to look for French brands that use beautiful fabrics, because I prefer naturel fabrics like cotton or wool. I never wear silk because It's too fragile for me. I'd rather wear long, white, cotton sleeve-shirts with warm, long, beige or black, wollen cardigans. I like to wear them with a pairs of jeans and my old brown French lace-up shoes. Like you see, there are very useful and comfortable for somebody living in the country side .

      Employees of implementation department work too much. The real problem is they are very tired while they have dangerous duties. Moreover the company is more and more often nearly outlawed about staff working time. This problems began with the lightning increase sales 4 months ago. The team morale is low and the boss understands he has to find solutions quickly. During a meeting with executive managers, the first strongly suggestion has been to enrich the team by hiring 3 more employees. An additional solution would have been to promote Peter as the manager of this department to better structure this activity and give limits to sales agents. Everyone has agreed on the fondamental need to react before a terrible accident happens.

      Is the gender equality achived in France? Note sure. All the industrialized countries have seen many women reaching leading roles in business and politics but it have been a long and hard road to achieve this. Women are increasingly represented in the most importants roles of our society but most of them still do not perceive the benefits of their performance equally to men. In 2010, french men earned 19 percent more than women. In politic, France is very far behind other european countries with a bad average of 19% of women elected in national assembly. Unfortunately, only the poverty and unemployment seem to not be sexists since it is the two areas in wich women are equal to men in France.

      I'm currently looking for a job, but it would be just for few months, time to set up my PhD program in Australia. It's quite hard to find a job because I realize that my qualifications don't interest many people. In fact, I followed two master's programs in space sciences in recent years. I got my Master's degree in astrophysics two years ago, and my Master's degree in planetology last year. Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree in fundamental physics, and subsequently my Honor's degree in the same field, fundamental physics. Frankly, no one cares about stars or physics in the 'real world' (I meant the working world). Anyway, I try to keep a positive mind. At least it lets me the time to study my english and build my australian project. This takes me a lot of time. I guess it's normal. It's about changing lifestyle, country and everything. It's a real effort, but I can't wait to be there. Everything will be better in the kangaroos' country.

      When I started my career, I believed that people was promoted based on talent. After few years, I changed my opinion when I became aware of the importance of office politics. In fact, my colleague had developed his network when I worked hard. In the result, he got the promotion; I didn't. I felt that it was unjust. Later, I understood that he succeeded because he was more than just talented and an expert at office politics. By contrast, my work wasn't sufficient and I neglected to strengthen my networking. Obviously, I was in bad position when it was time for a promotion. Since then, I decided to change my strategy. I've tried to integrate the game. First, I started to collaborate with my colleague who got the promotion. After, I asked him for advice. He explained to me that the best way to achieve my goal consisted of getting to know my colleagues and to show them respect. He told me not to forget to communicate regularly to my boss because he or she can be my biggest supporter. I admitted that I was uncomfortable practicing office politics but now I enjoy doing it and even giving advice to other colleagues.%%

      I definitly prefer to buy green product over brand which dosen't care of th environement.  But if you really want to choice the right product, with a minimum of information on the energy used, the packaging biodegradable or ,ot and so on you will discover that it's not evident to choose the right one. Sometimes the package is green and the product looks like it is environment frendly or bio but finally you cannot find any relevant information on the way it has been elaborated. So i think that if you are very motivated to use only real green products you have to go out of your way to find the right product.so if you do not have the time and the money to do this, which is my case you could start by changing your day to day behavior by for example using cermique cup instead of plastic glass, cooking yourself instead of buying prepared meals.

      Let me beguin by saying that it 's difficult to do buisness for my compagny because my cheif is very tough. He charged me to purchase  laptop  computer for my office. We were a meeting with my team and the seller. My team wanted something that they could use outdoor, something very durable. In the first time the seller said  the quantity we wanted bought  could not got  a big bulk discount. We were desapointed because we were expecting a lower price and we have some limitations. The seller said he could only offer  a small discount of 10 %.  Finally we made a breakthrough in the negotiation, and we ended to got 15% of discount and a service plan for 3years parts and labor. We were on the same page and bought  10 laptop for $800 each. The both sides were happy with the purchase made.

      I'm pretty optimistic about our future. Even technology will never solve all problems it can be useful. You can see, for example, how much the medical area uses new technologies.  We are also using them in daily life, with our smartphone. Everything seem much easier. But I also think that people need to be realistic. They need to understand that nothing can replace human brain, and you have to rely on yourself first. After all, without human being, there is any technology...

      Hello. My name is Sarah Owen and first of all I'd like to thank all of you for being here today. As you know, I am participating in the elections for the student council and I believe that I am the person you need as President. I am very well aware of the problems all of us have here: class furniture is in a deplorable condition, the food served at the cafeteria is expensive and tastes bad. We have fewer and fewer field trips because of insufficient funding and allocations have been made to departments that did not need them. Last year, summer classes were postponed at the last moment because of lack of maths and history teachers. Together, we will resolve all these burning issues. I believe that together we can change things. The student council and its President are answerable to the student body and I promise that if I am elected as President, I will ensure a close liaison between you and the council and together we will vote a priority list and determine together how we should act. I look forward to seeing you next sunday and make the right choice: Vote for Sarah.

We ordered first a local coktail with some apetizzers. For the starters Marine ate some scallops, and me a very fresh fish marinades. The Marine main course was a piece of beef with sauce of foie gras; for me it's a roasty piece of sea bass. The two menus were very freshs and tasties. The desserts 're the same for both: a delicat ice cream with some french britain's biscuits. This diner had been a very pleasent moment for us.

I advise you to follow those some rules please. Now, I explain the rules which are not mandatory. When you were invited to your friends, you can bring a wine bottle or bunch of flowers, you can share hands of your co-worker in entering and in exiting. Those rules help for good understanding .

      First, I graduated from college with a pharmacology diploma. Then, I had been working as a clinical research assistant in a pharmaceutical company during 1 year. This was my first contact with the industry, and I realized that I knew almost nothing about it. Subsequently, I decided to go back to school to get a management diploma.  Afterwards, I get a position in a biotech company as a health economic specialist.  I loved that job, working with people from medical, marketing, finance teams. After 3 years, I was promoted to market access manager. I had been working with the company head quarter on high potential drugs. This had been a very exiting position, that I had been holding during the four following years. Three years ago, I moved to follow my husband.  Consequently, I had to quit my job. I think it was the right time to have a break and focus on my family. I gave birth to 2 lovely children. Following this break, I decided to developed my own business, by doing free lance work for health companies. I am happy with this new challenge, that also allows me flexibility in time.

      I think that the main rules of behaviour are almost similar everywhere in the world and only details change. For example, in France like in other countries, when you're invited for a dinner, you are supposed to bring flowers to the lady of the house and, if she has young children, a little gift for them will be appreciated. You must arrive on time and, during the meal, keep attention to wait for the lady is served before beginning to eat; refusing to taste something  would be rude and - perhaps it's a French particularity - if your host opens a good bottle of wine, you would offend him if you said you don't like wine!

      Do you know our new Transformer Translator? Our translator has unique features compared to other translators. Let us begin with the basics: with a palm-size, our Transformer Translator translates 500 useful phrases into 50 languages. It is five times the number of phrases available with the teen translator. And our Transformer Translator costs less: $235 compared to $270 for the teen translator. Of course, you may tell me that the Translator 2 co does the same for only $200. But, this translator does not have this feature: our Transformer Translator is able to listen to your pronunciation and correct it in 50 languages. When you try it, you will understand why it is not a simple gadget. Other important features complete our product and make it unique: it has a world time zone clock, a currency converter, a world radio and a pedometer. You will not be able to travel without it once you try it. With all these characteristics, our product only weights 10 ozs compared to 20 ozs for the Teen Translator and 50 ozs for the Translator 2 co. Our product is so light that you will not feel that you carry it during your travels. So, our Transformer Translator is the most state-of-the-art product. It is now available for purchase.

      I was working as a chief financial officer for my company since 5 years and everything was going well. Three months ago, we hired a trainee to help me close my financial year. This day he was in my office and wanted me to explain him how the work goes in our company and how all the staff is. He was sitting in front of me and I was standing up with the door in my back. After explaining all the processes of the work, it's come the time to describe the staff. I was describing our general manager when I noticed that I seemed to be quiet embarrassed. I stopped my description and looked behind me: my boss was just here and was looking at me. He was really very upset. In fact my description was a little bit exaggerated, and I was joking about the way he spoke. I tried to explain it to my boss, and after warning me, he told me that my joke was quiet funny. Finally the issue wasn't as grave as I feared.

Once a week, on thursday exactly , we go to eat and drink something all together at the restaurant. Sometimes others go to run or play tennis together. Each employee works 37 hours a week or so. It's so important to have work-life balance in order to avoid the stress out. Where I work, each employee has five weeks' vacation each year, and each one can choose when he wants to take them. When the office culture is good, that allows to exercise your job in a good condition.

      Hi Everybody, First of all, I would like to thank you for coming here and celebrating the union of marriage of this totally wonderful young couple! My name is Franck and I am one of the best friend of the groom. Obviously, you should think I am going to toast Bertrand, and you are completely right! Indeed, we know each other since for such a long time from now on, that I could share many very funny stories about him...But I prefer to keep the strangest secret...After all he does not exactly married yet! However, I sometimes remember the time we spent on the benchs of the High School. Of course, he used to cheat on me during the exams and was probably the first to avoid working his houseworks. But, he knew how to put a very great atmosphere, and used to be the first to suggest a lot of activities such as sport, entertainment or trips! What I can say to the bride, is that she made an absolutely amazing choice, for sure. I am used to being proud of him, he is loyal, dynamic, smart and devoted to the people he likes. To conclude, I wish the best to both of them and I would like people here to raise their glass to the bride and the groom!%%

      Can you consider there is sexual harassment when a man claims he's treated less favorably than a woman by his boss who is a woman? How do you do when a job demands so much physical strength that only men can be hired (for example bouncer) or when it's about a typically female job as child minder? Do you consider that an add is discriminatory if its specifies only a man or only a woman is looked for because of the characteristic of the job? Indirect discriminations are proven with difficulty. How can you set the limit between complainant's imagination and reality?  Discriminations,especially indirect, take often place without witness. How can you prove facts? What do you think about the concept of positive discrimination? How can you justify that? Isn't it a discrimination, full stop? How do you do when a gender discrimination stems from a religion?%%

      1. Social-networking services just enable users to connect with others more quickly and less formally than by email. And they tend to allow users to send file attachments and use peer-to-peer programs, tools that are easily managed by system administrators. 2. Open interaction among users who may know each other but who could be strangers. With Networker or Homepage.com, people can maintain barriers against interacting with near-strangers. 3. Too much chatting and employees sheer existence on these sites can generate rumors about our company and its plans, and reveal informations to our competitors, like intellectual property. 4. Big names like ProfileMe and Networker allow you to adjust how much information others may access, due to the realization that possible security flaws could convince individuals and companies to avoid their sites. 5.

      I strongly believe success and failure hand in hand. If you're hoping to succeed, you've got to fail or learn from those who have. The most successful people understand the reality of failure and its importance in finding success. While you may want to run and hide after your fail, you must learn from your mistakes to ensure you don't fail in the same way the second time around. Those who are successful set daily goals. It's not always about luck. I mean, don't hold yourself back by waiting for the perfect timing or idea. Some of the most successful people got there by hitting the ground running, even if timing wasn't perfect. Truly successful people never give up. When I think of successful people, I think of Bill Gates. He inspires me because he is a very successful man. At the age of nineteen, he dropped out of Harvard not for lack of capacity, but to make a difference in the world and he did by forming Microsoft. Not only he is a great leader for his company, but he is also very generous. To put it in a nutshell, he is a role model.%%

      In France, some things have been changed between the roles of women and men. Why has it got those differences between these both genders hasn't it? Like many other countries, the men went to work while the women stayed for breeding the children and also stayed for doing the dish. Today the trends have been changing. Indeed, now the women are going to work and almost make the same salary like the men. Despite that, some men are staying as male chauvinist pig, they don't accept that the women earn more money than them. We live in a democratic country, and I think that the genders should be at the same level without discrimination toward each other.

      I have a friend who's attenting a university in the United States. We often discuss the similarities and differences between university life in the US and in our country. One of the big differences is flexibility. My friend tells me it's fairly common to change your major in the US. This is not the case in my country. Unlike the US system, it is very difficult to change your major. Being able to easily change majors makes sense to me, as a person's interests might change as well. Another thing my friend tells me that's different is the level of formality. Even though professors are respected, they can also be your friend. Students in some classes actually socialize with their professors. By comparison, I don't think I would ever go to a party or restaurant with one of my teachers. Just so you don't think everything is different, my friend tells me that students in America are pretty much like students in our country. They want to get a good education so they can get a good job and have a happy life, but they also want to have fun. That's something I think we can all agree on.%%

      About the future, i'm very optimitic. Also, i talk about the power of general technology : robotic, computer sciences, genetic, cybernetic, software and hardware. I take a realistic example such as Internet. Actually, you can use internet for everything you need. Paying your taxes, buying something, find a girlfriend. Buy the way, the developing world was just a little late but i think after 50 years it is ok

      I always see life with an optimistic point of view, maybe it's because I am young. I find fascinating all techonology which is developping and I admire all these people who work every day to improve ours lives. But adults often gave me a very pessimistic idea of future, and that worry me a little bit, but I rest confident. People can't let life getting worse, can them ?

      For the number of the TV we have in our house, I'm in the average with two televisions. It seems logic that unemployed people watch more TV because they have also generally more free-time. Concerning the repartition of the programs that people look, I'm happy, I'm younger than I think because at 50 years, I prefer movies than sports or game shows. I agree with the kind of programs that people prefer avoid. I hate reality TV and the talk shows too. In general, people prefer watch the news in the evening because it's the end of the day and the moment where you are at home. I'm not agree with the repartition male-female for the kind of movies we prefer. Despite I'm a woman I prefer exciting movies than romantic ones.

So you can see where you will be sitting and when you can get on the plane. You must show your passport and your boarding cart to a customs officer. On the boarding cart, you also will see the gate's number where you must be before the departure. On your luggage you must put a luggage tag with your name and you address to show that it belongs to you.

      From my childhood, I have always realized that life is that precious and short. I always taken the things conscientiously and with interest. Every things have driven me do not wast my time. I neither had health problem nor dead surrounded me, I think to be a lucky man. I continu to live my life like each day would be the last, because it can be that short It is not a game, whether you lose, you can not play again which is why i never forget to enjoy all moments with my daughter and my family.For time to time I have to travel.. almost 2weeks month. When your family miss you, then you realize that you ought to pass over the day to day grind, and small upsets. Peoples trend to negative attitude, et screw up their life. What pity. Everything is a used to take, positive attitude can be apply by everybody, anywhere at anytime. That can change your life.

      Dear Renee, Thank you for you e-mail. I really needed, like you, to know if I was a couch potato so I read the survey results in order to compare with my TV watching habit. According to my age, I agree with the survey. As the figures show about people of my age, I like to watch news and weather but I don't like reality TV, game shows and talk shows. Fortunately, I realised that I am not a couch potato because I don't watch TV too much. That was a big surprise for me. Ok, by the way, I have to leave you now. Take care, Fr.

      I prefer wearing classic, comfortable clothes, not stylish outfits. I'd rather wear natural fabrics than polyester. One of my favorite outfits is some nice, old pants with a thin, gray, cotton T-shirt. I like to wear it with my new, black tennis shoes. In the winter, I like to put on a big, black, polyester jacket. It's not natural fabric, but it's incredibly warm.

      Office Dress Code : All the employees must follow the dress code in the office: For men: You can wear the classic jeans and a shirt with the colors light, and sometimes the classic T-shirt (during the summer).But you should wear suit and tie during your appointment. For women: You can wear classic dresses and suits, or the straight skirt with blouse. For the color of your clothes you cant wear a hot color. For the jewels, you can wear classic earring , ring , necklace . These ones cant be fashion ( no plastic, no color, no big). Anybody cant wear: clothes too short, too baggy, to loose. You should have a stylist, because you are the picture of our company.

      Honestly, I can't describe a performing art that's unique to my city or place I have been living now, because it doesn't exist really. But it's possible to talk about a performance I saw yesterday in a small village of Jura, in France. It was a concert given by a a group of young musicians who came from Russia. Exacly, from St Petersbourg. The performance was one of a kind because the musicians used tradtional musical instruments from Russia, like balalaka and some others I don't even know the name. There is nothing like the rythme of these old songs from this country! Costumes also, were exquisite. In addition, what made this concert unique were the voices of two young women which were really wonderful. The place where the concert was sitting, is a little far from everywhere: A huge auditorium in the moutain! But, never mind. It well worth the money!

      Well I don't feel very optimistic about the future , it seems that we will have to work more and more to be paid less and less.  I believe that we have to build our own future if we want to keep going in a good way.

      In France, table manners and etiquettes are very important. This has to be applied whatever you are on a formal situation as business dinner, when you are invited at friends' home or when you are simply dinning at home. First of all, you have to quickly answer to invitation if needed, whatever you forecast to participate or not. Then, good etiquette is to bring with you a gift to your host, generally a bottle of wine or flowers. When dinning, you have to respect some rules : wait until your hosts begin eating and don't speak with a mouth full. A really important rule is to avoid to make phone calls or send message texts while you are at the table. If you need to answer an important call, then apologize yourself and leave the table. After the dinner, don't forget to thank your hosts and send them a short message (whatever call or mail) to thank them again for the dinner.

      Terms of reference This report presents the results of a survey about general employee satisfaction at Hays and Sons. Procedure About 10% of the total employees have answered the survey which represents a good sample in terms of age, sex and cultural background.  Findings Most people are happy about the employee basic package. However they deplore the overtime culture. They are regularly expected to work around the clock and are never rewarded. Most employees are satisfied with the employee advanced package but think that two years to be eligible is too long. Conclusions Hays and Sons employees are generally satisfied with their working conditions but some points might be improved. Recommendations In order to improve the working environment we suggest that the company rewards staff in some way when they work overtime. Another way to meet higher satisfaction would be to shorten the time before being eligible to the employee advanced package.%% 18 months seem to be a more realistic period.

The people run in front they in the streets and in the beach. Sometimes the bulls have fire in their horns, also they can dropped to the sea. I think this tradition of playing with bulls is awful. They are animals, and they suffer. There are also other popular traditions like the &quot;cabezudos&quot; or &quot;castellers&quot;. The first one is the people who disguises with old clothes and placed in their heads very large masks. They dance and parade in the streets. The &quot;castellers&quot; are a castle with people. That is very popular the exist also competitions of &quot;castellers&quot;, the highest, which lasts longer. Is really interesting and good because that is as un sport.

When I have taken the apartment, I have noted some problems like the lights that didn't working, the drains clogged and the roof that was leaking. The landlord told me that I knowed these problems but it wasn't written on the contract. I have told him that there is consumer protection laws but what can I do now ? I hope you can help me. Best regards, Mrs Jones

      Dear Polary, Thank you for asking me for advice on shopping addiction. Here is plan that might work for you. Firstly, you should when you feel alone, depressed or stressed, go to a quiet place where you will not find in stores. A park, for example, will be the perfect place to relax, reflect and relax. Secondly, how about doing some activity like sport, a drama class or dance? Finally, when you feel ready to complete your withdrawal period, go shopping. But not in the usual conditions: make a list and stick to it.

      The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn 1h 47 min Animation/Action/Adventure Director: Steven Spielberg The first quality of this film is not to be too faithful to the original material. However, Herg's spirit is present throughout the film, especially in his loyalty to the ingenuity of gags and plot twists. Great characters, with a more opportunistic Tintin, a Captain Haddock more buffoon and less grumpy, and a Snowy as a true ally. All this take place in a happy story that breathes the pleasure of the action. A playful film, full of details in its decorations, which extraordinary beauty gives a own life to the universe of Tintin. Spielberg delivers a paced film. The camera is swirling and alert, with use of a steadycam that shows how the technical mastery is always the prerogative of the most faithful film of Spielberg. To be seen and enjoyed!

      Hi Shelley,I have a great news for you. Do you remember about the sand painting that you asked me for? I think that I had found exactly the sand painting that you want. The design is C-shaped like you desire. Inside the painting, there is a person with a square face who is holding both arms up toward the sky. The form of his body was long, narrow and rectangular. This person was wearing a skirt with an oval on it. There were a lot of colors in this sand painting: red, yellow and brown. I am sure that you will be happy about that. Please give me your opinion about that?Best regards.

      One player has got to throw a ball as far as he can do it (inside the game area of course). Another player has to run and fetch that ball. In the same time, the 10 others players have to run and change their room (you've got 10 differents pitches). If a player was unable to change and get another place before the ball is caught, then he loses and quit the game. The thrower is not all the time the same, each player has got to be one during the game.

      For our daughters birthday we went to a restaurant called ' lAbsinthe ' that she had chosen. In fact a friend of her who had recently eaten there, said it was wonderful, so we made a reservation for three persons at 8 pm. When we arrived, the place didnt look exquisite but it was enough casual. We ordered an aperitif; I took one without alcohol while the others ordered an Absinthe. My husband put his glass down and the waitress gave him another one.  The dishes were all delicious. The appetizers that we choose were very good; mine was a cold soup of asparagus. My husband and my daughter ate a Shrimp salad that seemed very tasty but Im allergic and I cant eat shrimp. Its really a pity. The main courses were also wonderfull. That was fish with some vegetables, all was delicious. I said the ingredients were very simple but the cooking transformed them into magic. The chef said all the vegetables were very fresh and organic. Of course the desserts were as delicious as the other dishes, and when we have gone out we were very happy for this great moment of gastronomy.

      Here I write several questions where I need answer about personal experiences from people who was victim about discrimination. I will ask questions to male and female gender. Do you know the several types of discrimination? You think you were affected for a selection for a job, training, promotion, work practices or for dismissal and the cause issued was discrimination? What is your domain of activity? (company product or service) If you were already pregnant, how was you come back at the office? (after the period) Have you an example, of a case where you was not invited to meet clients? If you were a victim from sexual harassment or any case of discrimination, what did you against this problem?

      An international study, which has been published around one or two weeks ago, told that French employees are lazier, but more productive than the others in the world. It seems to me to be a perfect definition of the French labour culture: it's okay to be efficient at work, but not to the detriment of the lifestyle balance. Indeed, French labour policy has been made to preserve it like working 35 hours a week, little flexibility in overtime or 5 weeks vacation a year. Obviously, lifestyle balance isn't the only reason, but here is our culture: working to earn money and earning money to have a good lifestyle balance.

Their salary was more down  of 30 to 40 percent that men for the same work. The women worked in the factories and hadn't executive position. Only, after the 1990 years, the women began to have the executive positions and take a great place in the economic of country .

But it was a fallback career until the economy fall drastically with the bublle burst and I lost clients over cjlients. I quited this job because I didn't earn my life enough.

      I travel often and I work with different people in different office cultures. All depends on the project on I'm working and the phase in which I was integrated. The classic team with I work is about eight person so. Twenty per cent internal and eighty per cent external give or take. The relationship between the external consultants is generally very good; we spend time together outside the office. We go out to dinner or for drinks two times or so a week. Internal colleagues are still customers and we cant talk about everything with them. Given the nature of my job, it's hard to have a healthy work-life balance. In fact, lots of my colleagues are divorced...

      Ideally, success would mean a complete achievement of a professional and/or personal project. It could bring notoriety, financial benefits, or 'something' special that everyone could admire. As an example, Steve Job is a model of success and everyone knows his story, his ability to lead a company to a planetary commercial success. Consequently, everyone knows his failures, his good and bad habits. In Steeve Job's cases, his success is so focused on his person and his mind than his life seems to miss some equilibrium. In reality, success is probably more complex. Taking example about a colleague of mine, Joaquim C. working as a marketing manager, it is possible to achieve a great carrier inside a big company and to stay quiet anonymous regards to the world. The traits of his success can be summarized as a balance between several success : individual development, recognition of his peers, ability to lead projects successfully through crisis, commitments of his colleagues to his goals, familly balance and healthy body. Unlike Steve Job, Joaquim as met success but anonymously. Therefore, success is really a matter about what you expect in your life and what you intend to do.

      I do not like much travelling. One time I flew to Lisbonne ten years ago. I had a plane change at Porto. The trip was short, I did not feel jet lag. I had no problem with customs. I had to take a taxi to go to my hotel. It was a nice old fashion hotel. I ate out all days, it was not very expensive. I have never left Europe.  My last travel was on february 2013. I went in Vienna with a friend. It was a really good trip.

      I like to travel very much. I've traveled in Italy. I've seen Vatican and the famous Sixtine Chapelle and Colliseum. It was very amazing and cultural. I've stayed in a hotel in the center of Rome, it was very expesive but very accessible having a walk in the old romanian city, or eating delicious italian food, like pasta and pizza at a terrace. I haven't been yet to Sicile, but i really want to go. My last trip in Ukraine was horrible. When i arrived, the airline have lost my luggage , and i had to buy some clothes for changing.

      I first met my wife as we were both studiants in the same unversity. I'm afraid it's very usuel to meet your spouse at work. I was at the first row in a big amphitheatre, and she was a few rows behind me. I don't know how it was possible because she was in my back but I noticed this pretty girl with her dark eyes, dark hair and her gold pair of earings. Maybe the teacher wasn't very interesting and the girl did. Anyway, a few days later, by chance, we were in the same little group for practical work. We went out for a drink and twenty years later we are married and have four children.

      I experienced a lot of stress in my job until my redundancy. I was, for about ten years, the Financial Manager of several companies, so I had much responsabilities. I worked more or less fifty hours a week, responsible for the accountancy and paychecks. But i was happy. My job was interesting, I earned a lot of money, I met many different people like lawyers. Also, I practised some sports, like tennis or basketball, and I'm healthy. My job was the most important thing for me. So, I'm a bachelor for a long time. Now, I'm 41 years old, I'm unemployed but I'm not unhappy. I realize that I have all the time now to do what I never did before : meet a woman, have kids and buy a house. I think that I won't be happy in my life if I stay single, even if I find a good job.

      I bought a new laptop two years ago and it has changed my life : prior to buy it, I have a little notebook, which was very powerless and which had a little screen. With my new laptop, I have a best Internet connection and I can use powerful softwares. It has a larger creen, a larger keyboard and it is faster in starting. Furthermore, the battery lasts long. Moreover, I didn't cost too much compared with its qualities. Unfortunately, when it runs big softwares or when I watch videos, the blower is very noisy because the computer strongly heats and sometimes, when it has overheated, it crashed. I am very happy to have this device because I can work in better conditions for my studies and I gain time when I see my mails, when I want to search something in the Internet or when I enter text in a document.

      In early 1990, we just had one television channel, but since 10 years we have the cable and a lot of channels: three to ten local channels and about twenty international channels. It is really amazing, now we can have easily access to the worlds information just on our screen television. In addition, we have now laptop computer, tablet and smartphone which are another type of medium. Just by clicking on a mouse, or blinking we can read a lot of informations written not just by professionals, but also by any person whose has a laptop and an internet connection. Even me, I could create my own blog where I could write articles and news about my country. There is any restriction, just have a computer and an internet connection. Thus, the way we knew the information has totally changed,  now everyone can give information. The bad thing is that there is no control on these informations. They can be totally wrong or not objective. So nowadays you have to be very careful about the place you collect your information.

      In France, as far as I'm concened, I haven't noticed gender inequality in terms of salary but it doesn't mean that we have equal salary for equal work whatever the gender. To me, the gender differences appears when it comes to high status, high job with high responsability. Unfortunately, I guess the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; for the women is a reality especially regarding the nomination to the highest position. Then, many people always have an archaic behaviour about women and continue to think as at the last century. Indeed, the more disturbing is that it isn't just some men who have this behavior, even some women defend tooth and nails a scheme where women are submitted to her husband. Who knows? Maybe do women really like to be submissive and obedient? Of course, I don't think so at all !  I guess we have to give time at time.

What I really enjoyed was that one speaker came from the UK to tell us about the market trends there and that the organizers of the event ended the show with the French Facebook team who told us about new marketing solutions. I had to admire that they know how to convince people. On the other hand, brand leaders and digital experts often stayed away from the audience questions. I would have liked them to better answer to consumer doubts and business expectations. Nevertheless, I liked the way we all discovered new opportunities for the future.

      Hi Ian! How's it going? Well, I would like to tell you some advices before you tender your resignation for good. I know you have been suffering of claustrophobia for a long time, but I don't think this resignation is the best option. First of all, you have to try to confront your irrational fears rather than to avoid them. I understand you are afraid of getting on the subway since we have been relocated. Therefore, to avoid that, you should take deeply and slowy breath when you are in a confined spaces, that could help you a lot. Another good treatment will be to learn and practice relaxation techniques. You should think about joining a support group as well. You could meet and talk to people who will understand your phobia. So, keep that different kinds of help in mind, and, please reconsider your resignation. By now! Anna

      I feel strongly that there are too many commercials on tv in my country. For example, most shows have 20 minutes of commercials an hour. Every 10 minutes, they stop the story to show some commercials. In my opinion, the commercials are also very successful because of the jingles. First, you hear a soda jingle. Soon, you are loundly singing that jingle in the kitchen with a big glass of their soda in your hand. Basically, i can't stand commercials. We need to ask for more restrictions on them.

      Me who has only 18 years old, I was really lulled by the new technologies. That was the beginning. For my personal work, whether at college or high school, it was necessary to have a computer at home. On the other side that the school environment, technologies have completely changed way we travel. For example, you've just landed and a new country is offered to you. You don't know where to stay ? No problem, one click separates you from your hotel room. In addition, we can not count the number of comparators flight looking for a place on the net. Enter a destination and date to reveal the best prices of a lot of airlines. I love traveling, I can find my flight in five minutes ! How much faster !! Finally, social networks have allowed me to find more friends in all corners of the globe ! It's great to be able to see their different way to live ! I hope to see them one day in real or why not go and visit them in their country ! In brief, Internet allows me to make my life a real joy !!

      I work in a company of about 15 employees. Theres no particular dress code and the working atmosphere is comfortable. I get along with most of my colleagues. Hierarchical relationships are low, which is not always the case in big companies. Actually, executives and managers may be patronizing and arrogant with staff members. In spite of all these benefits, Im overworked and stressed out. My lunch break is short and I often dont take time to eat correctly in order to reach my goals by the deadline.  My colleagues and I eat frozen ready meals very often.  Unless you are doing an exercise routine and eating healthier foods, its difficult to have a good work-life balance.

      Our research shows that there are 29% of 15-19 year-old women purchasing at least one magazine per month in comparison to 47% of 18-24 year-old men. Most of women prefer magazines to blogs,(69%). Similarly, 72% of men prefer magazines with extensive website content. There are a variety of women magazine in the market, 6 competitive products for the time being. In contrast, the men magazine is still a potential market, provided there are 1 long term magazine and 2 recent competitive products. The actual figures show that there are less women purchasing magazines than men, but both demographic groups present a growth tendency, which is estimated a rise in purchase by 22 billions of women and 2 billions of men. On the one hand, women purchasing power is less then men as shown in the research, but on the other hand, in the future, there will be a fall in number of men. From 2010 to 2025, there is an estimated fall of 5 million of men. Contrastingly, there will be a rise of 6 million of women. Eventhough, the men purchasing power is always higher.

      Hi Sophie I can't stop myself from writing to you, since I heard a new song called &quot;Home improvement&quot;.Maybe you heard it too ?At first it doesn't seem very edgy, kind of a traditional pop song.But when you keep on hearing it, the voice of the singer (hot and nice) and especially the beat, (so much catchy that you can't get it off your head) tend to make you feeling relaxed and happy. I heart that outstanding song at least 5 or 6 times running, without tiring of it ! And I always feel like dancing on it.So don't wait, and go and buy it quickly, you won't be disappointed ! And tell me what you think about it.

      Dear Teacher, I would like to have the pleasure to say that the successful person I admire is myself, unfortunately it's wrong. Besides it's difficult to find at work a person that I admire exept perhaps my CTO. The most important trait that I admire is entrepreneurship. It rather difficult for me to understand how a single person can create his own business and later being the boss of his own company. Moreover I admire all the researcher and their capability to invent something that nobody in the world has already discovered. In addition, the people who take care of the others as a volunteer is the kind of person I would like to be. However I am too busy to spend time as a volunteer. In my point of view, the most successful story is the adventure of Bill Gates. He was a great inventor, entrepreneur and businessman. He was the best in his job and had a great idea with the creation of &quot;windows&quot;. Plus, he was capable to have his operating system mandatory for the all the computers all over the world. In fact, he had an incredible sense of business. Best regards

      Nileretail shows more strong points than Shopping Space website. On nileretail.com, online customers can search specific genres and even rare books quickly thanks to its great usability while one the-shopping-space.com, users have to scroll through all of the screens to see what they are looking for. Besides, the product range and quality is also a key point of online shopping. Nileretail shows its advantages when there are both new and used books for users to choose. Shopping Space is less attractive, a small range of items and cheap, casual quality make users lose their eagerness to purchase. Moreover, the payment and delivery options are more diverse on Niteretail than on Shopping space. People shopping on Niteretail can have possibility of getting free delivery. Furthermore, Niteretail's design is far better then Shopping Space, for its more attentive understanding of customers' needs. Some extra features gives customers as much pleasure as shopping in the store, like &quot; search inside the book&quot; button. However, customer service of both websites needs improving.

It describes the story of a person who leaves the countryside to live in city. I don't think it will be very popular with their fans.

      In fact, Im neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future, Im rather very curious and a little excited, as everything could happen: the best as well as the worst. As for the best, we could imagine the end of autocratic regimes and the spread of democracy all over the world, the end of poverty, of discriminations, the development of technologies and what that means in term of improving the quality of life. As for the worst, we could feared the utilization of the nuclear weapon, the exacerbation of fundamentalism and terrorism, the utilization of technologies to spy and enslave individuals and, why not, we could imagine the seizure of the power by the robots, like in science fiction, frightening, brrrrrrrrrrrr!!!

      In France, people are very friendly but if you are invited to a French person's home you must know the correct etiquette. First, you must bring a small gift: a bunch of flowers, a bottle of wine or alcohol, chocolates... If your hostess has got children, you can bring toys or sweets. Then, it's good to come a quarter later: don't come earlier! When you are eating, don't slurp or burp! You must use spoons, foks and knives but , not your fingers! At the end of the meal, compliment your host on the cooking. Don't speak only about you and your life! Smoke, unless you know your host also smokes. Even then, only smoke when he does.

      Although French government has been constantly taking preventive measures to reduce it, the rate of unemployment is unhappily increasing and the present economic,financial, political situation is not looking up at all. So, how can an employee significantly reduce his expenses if he spends half of his salary on rent, utilities and transportation? That is one of the basic problem of our society. Well, even if a family budget is carefully planned, more and more families are concerned about the way to save money. Unfortunately, after the deductions like food costs,taxes, their plan often goes over budget! Despite of these difficult financial conditions if you can afford to buy a flat or a house, you must pay attention to what the bank is going to suggest to you to stay in good shape and manage your finances for a very,very long time. When your flat or your house will be paid, you won't be very young. Don't forget it please!

A very famous jazz band is going on next month at the Huchette Club, we hope to see you there. Thanks ever so much again, see you, kiss. Christophe

      Hi, Anna ! I've found the perfect job for you! If you want to work with animals you can get a zookeeper place to the Flossington Zoo. The wage is totally incredible. It is barely $50,000. This zoo is by far the most exhilarating zoo of the country! It owns the most spectacular animals i've ever seen. That's why I really urge you to apply for this job. Nonetheless I know that you wouldn't get a dangerous job. The issue is that you will go to Florida to observe wild crocodiles. To me they are absolutely atrocious, but what a rush for people who like animals! I think this job is for you and i do encourage you to apply for it. It could be the most unbelievable activity you could do in your all life. See you soon!

      I'm not optimistic about the future. In my opinion, I think that by this way of using the renewable energy we cannot fight against global warming. This method is used in a very limited way and it cannot respond to the challenge. Also if we look around us, we can believe that pollution will increase more and more. In fact, technical progress and population growth will cause negative effects on the earth. For me, I cannot guess about the future if we stay on this condition. I hope so that I will be wrong but we must be realistic.

      Hi Anna, I found an ad which could be totally interessting for you. It is by far the most exhilarating job. It is to be a zookeeper. You will work animals as you wanted to do. Also, it is well payed and you wil have some very amazing benefits such as 1 month holiday every year, regular trips to Florida to observe wild crocodiles and full accident insurance off course. However,You will have some responsibilities, indeed you will have to prepare food for animals and feed them everyday. I urge to consider for applying for this job because it meets you requirements. So I encourage you to have some thoughts about this. Please answer me as soon as possible and let me know. Regards,

      I live in France and as in other countries, there is a lot to say about its quality. It's usual to complain but we must to be as objective as possible. The TV French system is not so bad than the people think, there is an assembly of independant people who check the programs and give instructions about them. No connection with the the government, no connection with political parties. So even there are silly programs as life shows where an unknown person go in front of the camera and made crazy things only to be able to chat with his colleages the day after, even if there are too much US series, one more violent than the others, we find many interesting documentaries or many programs which help people to think by their own.

      I remember when I started my career, one of our clients convened our sales director to complain about the delay of project. I was so nervous that I couldn't even focus in my work. Indeed, the client decided to give up the contract that he already had signed with my company. It was an awkward situation. My director went to meet our client with the certitude that not only he were going to stop their professional relationship but also were going to demand damages. After this meeting, our sales director assured us that he finished it in good terms and better he could negotiate another contract. What a good surprise! I can't help myself asking him how he finally managed to correct and reverse this situation in our favour. He simply explained me that he could reach his goal in two steps. First, when the client was still angry, he stayed in his control, he listened to him carefully, he showed a sincere empathy and he apologized for the delay. Then, once our client became calm, he proposed him the best way our company was going to resolve his matter as soon as possible. Plus, he dared make an offer to him about our new product and he convinced him to sign another contract.%%

      I have just heard a song that called &quot;home improvement&quot; by Josh Woodward. The song has kind of a sentimental melody. You cannot really dance on this music because there is not much of a beat. The singer have a very good voice but for me the mood of this music is not edgy. It is a song very girly and &quot;commercial&quot;. Lot of other singers sing song like this. For me it is not very original. I prefer a singer like Woodkid... So, i do not recommand this music because for it is not catchy but if you like a singer like rock voisine... Let's buy the cd!

      Since 30 years, there are more and more constraints in France. In the begining it was about the consumption of alcohol and the prohibition of smoking in the public places. For example, it is forbidden putting a cigaret on a movie poster, but also making advertisment for alcohol brands. This law have been written to not attract children. Nowadays, there is a new law in discussion at the parlement, around the electronic cigarette. There is also a reinforcement of the controls on the roads. In front of this augmentation of restrictions, a big anger is climbing.

      In France, the trend after high school is to choose between university or &quot;Grande Ecole&quot;. At the university it'snt unusual for a student to get online course. Before to obtain your pass to &quot;Grande Ecole&quot;, you have to study for two years,  and it's not unusual to fail this big test. I'm totally in favor of this trend because it gives you the choice between two different kind of study. It's more difficult at the beginning in the &quot;Grande Ecole&quot; way but easer after.

It is really difficult to work without any rest but you have the spirit team to help. But during the winter, we are bored because we are alone with nothing to do. We do not have anymore stress in our life and it is really easy to felt in a big depression. Can you imagine staying at home during four or five months?

      My new GPS watch has totally changed my alpinism practice. Before, when the weather was bad, I needed use an compass, and a map to find the track. This operaton took too long. I enter the coordinates of the destination and follow the direction indicated on the watch. But also i can see the altitude, the ascensional speed, etc.. And is it possible to save the tracks and all data. Before that functionality, I needed prepare the route with a map and memorize this route or take note on paper. Now you can charge the route on your watch, and the best, many route are available on internet, you win many time.  The only one problem is the battery capacity if you go walk more than two day you need to find some electricity, to refill batteries.

      To help me with my vocabulary, I read the newspaper almost everyday. This helps me to learn new words, and also to increase my reading capabilities in the understanding of some words meaning, only based on the context. An other way to improve both my vocabulary and my pronunciation is to watch some TV shows with English subtitles. I think it's also a good way to memorize those vocabulary items because you will easily recall them whenever you will visualize the movie scene in your mind. I wish I knew more about English day to day expressions to communicate more effectively with any native speaker.  To achieve this goal, my advice to myself will be not hesitate to start a conversation with an English speaker even though I make some grammar or tense mistakes.

You have to communicate with your colleagues and update the database : everybody in the team have to know the work to do. After, you must be more carefully with time management : you must not be late for appointments. Then, you must be more tidy : don't forget documents and clean when you mess up. In fact, you must be more professional.%% I hope you will improve your habits rapidly. Yours Faithfully,

When she was approaching the corner at Elm and Fourth, she saw a young couple get out of a car and suddenly began vandalizing the local news agents. Meg decided to go over to them to see if she could get them to stop. Suddenly the young woman came at her waving a gun! She pushed the gun into her stomach, and started talking very fast about consumerism and the evils of the modern world. Meg was shaking and terrified. After what seemed like a lifetime, the vandal grabbed the laptop off her and run down the street. A passer-by chased the vandal and caught her by the hair but she managed to escape. This wasn't her hair but a wig and the woman was in fact a teenage boy! They haven't caught the couple yet

Besides, we created a lot of products to make life easier or more ecologic, after we realize that they are dangerous for human body. For example, this tiny robots who will find and destroy cancer cells. I totally disagree with this way to do.

For example, I don't like to get up early, so mainly I start to work at about nine o'clock in the morning. It's a very good thing and gives you a lot of liberty. The only thing is to be able to finish your duty on time. But it's also a double edge sword because you have to be very careful with your private life.

      In France, children can go to school when they are 3 years old. I think it's important for us to go at school early because they learn to live with other children. Then elementary school is very quite important because children begin to learn reading and writing. In the middle school, children can be mixed with bad students and unfortunatly, the teacher cares about students with problems : Good students have to wait for them. It's a waste of time for the last one. That's why if I had a child, he would go on a private elementary and middle school.

      To help me with vocabulary, I use specific English books. I like learning vocabulary this way because it provides a definition, but also some synonyms and antonyms for each word. It helps me to make a relation between words. Furthermore, these books are interesting because for each part, there are some small texts where the words I learnt are used. It is a good manner for me to help me to remember the words. Furthermore, it is important to me to see the word in a sentence or in a text, to learn the vocabulary in relation with the topic.

      From : me ! To xxx@q1234.com Today, Hey, Thank you for your mail. It's really a good life experience . I also think that around the world people can be kind and helpfull. My story is different ! I was sleeping under a tent in the Pyrennes Mountains (South of France). In France you can have camping for one night where you want with an aproval. I have been waked up by a very strange noise not far from me. I love camping, alone an far from all but this time I was so scared that I couldn't even shout. It was a noise as steps of an animal. I couldn't do anything, so I did ... nothing but wait for a very very long time until the sun rise. The day after, I met two people speaking about a bear which have been seen recently. I have never kwown if it was my night visitor or not ! They told me bears never attacks human !!! But now, I never go camping alone; See you Marie-Franoise Sorry, it's maybe a little too long............

      Dear nanny, Here are the people's routines you will have to take care of : Sean plays basketball every afternoon, and plays computer games at 6pm. He watches movies on Saturday at 5pm. Granny does the laundry on Tuesday afternoon, and does the gardening in the morning. And she sets the tables at 6pm. I feed the dog at 8am every day, and walk it in the afternoon. I feed it again at 5pm every day. You'll have to do these routines for me. Bests regards, James

I want to tell you sorry for my attitude to the waiter and all the remarks I have made about him because he was a liltle bit sick and disorganized in its table service. I think it was a wrong day for him that's why he have had some problems with the dessert. I hope next time the service will be better. See you soon Your friend John

      Dear Mayor Bleak,I am writing to you to express my concerns about the new Super Mart that is to be built in our town. I strongly believe that it will destroy the community and change the way we live together. I must admit that Super Mart will probably make shopping easier for consumers and will provide them with convenient, one-stop shopping at low prices but at what cost?Indeed, Super-Mart offers minimum-wage jobs and no social or health benefits. It is not a good opportunity for the unemployed who will be underpaid and suffer from substandard labor practices. Furthermore, my parents own their grocery shop and they will inevitably have to sell before they go bankrupt. Actually, it is a fact that businesses which have been running for generations usually close down after the opening of a new Super Mart in the neighborhood. For all these matters, I'd like you to recosider the project of a new Super Mart and find another way to reboost our local economy.Yours sincerely...Milena

      I want to believe that every law has a reason to be and is not vain. In my opinion, the police is here for us to live a safe life and not to annoy us. It is true that some laws can be hard to follow but when you think about it a bit more, they always have a reason to be. For example, in France, we have a lot of restrictions concerning how we should drive. We are not allowed to use cell phones or use anything that might distract us are there are speed limitations everywhere. But thanks to this, the number of car crashes have distinctly decreased during the last few years.

      Last week-end I listened the song ''Home Improvement'' from singer Josh Woodward. This song spoke to me and I listened again yesterday to have a more accurate idea of it. This song let me puzzled, it's not a bad song but not really finished. It's a folk song with all the pictures according to that style: the country, a farmer, etc. The melody is pretty catchy and I immediatly remebered it but the musical theme is too repetitive.  The rhym isn't agressive tough a beat a bit too fast. The lyrics are rather political and some of people will like them, however in my opinion, it's difficult to find out if the singer is really sad. The singer has a good range but the high notes are reached with a bit of difficulty. However it's a good song and i recommend it

During the meeting, I told him I was now engineer, I had enouth money in my bank account, and 5000 on another bank account. Finaly, the banker accepted a counteroffer of 70 more each mounth. The loan has been reduced from 2 years. I'm happy to have reduced the end of my loan. Next 3 years, I will buy another apartment and learn how to negociate the price much better.

The houses trembled but there wasn't a lot of destruction. I heard a terrible noise under my feet. Then, all of a sudden, everything was calm. The calm lasted for about 50 minutes, and then the earth began again to tremble. I was very afraid. The relief operations were necessary to help the victims. No one was killed in the disaster, but many were hospitalized. I'll never forget it. I learnt that the nature is often stronger than people.

      I enjoy into &quot;Belote&quot; The rules are very simple and when I play with some friends we are not so strict than during an officiel play because we can laugh and tell stories. To play &quot;Belote&quot; we must be four persons. First, we distribute five cards to each player and the distributor must show the next card to all player and then each player can choose this card for asset. If nobody choose this card, one after the other can choose the asset he wants. Finally if nobody choose an asset, we change the distributor and the play will restart. Otherwise if someone chose an asset, the distributor gives 3 last cards to each player and two last cards to leader. The highest cards are the assets, and the biggest is the Valet and after they are the Nine, the As, the Ten, the King, the Queen, the Eight and the Seven. And for the other cards it's the As, the Ten, the King, the Queen, the Valet, the Nine, the Eight and the Seven. The first player must put on the table a card and after each player should put on a card from the same sign and if you haven't a card from the same sign you must cut with an asset and you haven't an asset you have to an other card but you couldn't be master from the play.%% It's not allowed to put an asset if you can put a card with the same sign.

      Skydiving is my favorite hobby. I took up skydiving ten years ago when one of my classmate decided to give up university to become a skydiving instructor. I went to his club and first did some training with a teacher. I liked pushing myself to the limit. I began to follow serious lessons and little by little I passed the different level exams. I do not say that it is easy to jump out of the plane and to do some free fall of one minute or even more. But it is so exciting to feel the thud of my heartbeat and finally, when you touch the land, to say &quot;I did it !&quot;. As much as you improve you overcome your fear of height and only the freedom you feel in the air remains. As like my friend did with me, I try to take some friends with me for a visit the club.

      To summarize, the price/quality ratio was excellent. The atmosphere was great and friendly. But a bit noisy. The taste of white wine was delicious. And red wine was at the right temperature. The slice of beef I ate was tender and slightly rare. However, I found that there was to much cream in my dessert. And the coffee was a bit drowned in water. Our waitress was very professional and elegant. He has good advice. The service was excellent. Well done !

      Last month I have been invited to a presentation about the new technologies. One thing the presenter did well was to use visual aids as pie charts and bar graphs. It allowed everybody to easily understand the main ideas. He perfectly explained the situation and his arguments were really compelling. I have to admire how clear he was offering many examples to each point. However, one thing he could have done differently was to let people ask some questions. If he had given time for that, the participants would have contribute a lot. The introduction didn't really work because I didn't understand immediatly the topic of the presentation. And I'm still not sure about the solutions and ideas he gave in conclusion. Finally, I think that the presentation was very interesting and that the presenter has a large knowledge. Maybe would it be appropriate in the future to prepare better the introduction and the conclusion.

      I think that future will be worse than today. Of course technology will improve and could help some people to have a healthier life, but most of progress will be made in war technology and the main aim will remain the survey and control of citizen. The future will be amazing for the richest people and the smart businessmen who will create new fake needs of 3D cellphones. This developement will accelerate pollution and environement diseases. Technology could be a part of the solution but the first step to avoid this future is that everyone change his own priorities.

Moreover, she didn't use any illustrations, figure, any support for we more understood. This is not a good speaker. She was so serious, we were expecting bad news. One thing she could do differently was talk a bit louder because we didn't hear anything.

      Dear Mayor Bleak, I am writing to you to express my deep concern about the coming of a big company of distribution like Super-Mart in our town .I am really worried about the negative consequences of this company that would have in our local economy .The small businesses wouldn't have the financial capacity to compete with this big company and they could disappeared . This situation would be dramatical for most of the employees of small businesses who would lose their jobs .In adddition , this kind of company didn't have any sense of community work like the small businesses .Therefore , most of our social work wouldn't find any financial support . Finally, the unemployment will probably rise sharply . According to these bad consequences of this company on our environment , I am convinced that a strict conditions must be fixed and respected for this kind of companies .Otherwise, it could be a disaster for our town.

      To my mind green business represents all differents actions implemented by companies in order to be environmentally friendly. For instance, a corparation can have a program to save energy inside their buildings or to avoid waste of papers and furnitures. I think green business is taking a greater part in our life because of the problem of climate change and the increasing number of inhabitants of Earth. Indeed, statitics stated that the number of inhabitants in 2040 will amount to around 9 billion people. So we will have to use the same natural ressources with a soaring number of inhabitants. That is why it is crucial that environmental issues become a top subject in all countries and not only in the most developed one. However, paradoxically I do not go out of my way to buy green products. The main reason is that they are more expensive that regular products and I am still a student. Besides I have some doubt about some companies which pretend to sell environmentally friendly products.

My fear of the ocean prevents me from surfing. - You don't like this sport? - No, this sport is dangerous. I just never like a thrill-seeker. Never was. The surf clearly has its risks. - Is true, but little by little, you could lost your fear of deep water, little by little, you could become a very good skier. You'll see that is an amazing experience! You'll be completely transfixed. -Ok. But today I'll be happy to stay on the beach, to marvel the sun and the huge waves.

      Currently, I'm working in a music school as head teacher. I had an extensive experience, a solid background in music teaching and I was recognized to get manager of the music school. If I may say so, I'd always been passionate about music before I decided to be a musician. Frankly, my teacher has given me a hard time. Apparently he was right because I was recognized for my hard work with an award. However my parents worried about my future because of the money. I was not aware regarding difficulties but I was not in it for the money. Ideally I could perform in concert and earn money enough but realistically I thought I'll be managing my own music school. What would happen if the economy falls drastically and I had to close my store ? I suppose I'd go back to my concert's business travelling around the world. Frankly I'm not sure where I'll be in 5 years but in those days I'm doing well playing and teaching music. Things are always looking up. I guess so.

The owner made a counteroffer of $80,000. We said that we were sorry, but we just didn't have the money. We also told the owner how much we loved the car. Then, suddenly, we heard from the owner.

      What's important in life One thing I've learned as I've gotten older is that it's important to live every day as if it were your last. You never know what's coming tomorrow. What's most important to me is my health. Without your health, you can't do anything. I try to exercise and eat nutritious food, and I also try to laugh as much as possible. If laughter is the best medicine, it's because of the happiness it brings you. Laughing with my grandkids is just about the best thing in the world to me. I don't have any time for being depressed or anxious. Life's too short. I only wish I'd known that when I was younger. I wasted a lot of time worrying about ridiculous things. Whoever said that youth is wasted on the young knew what they were talking about.

      Does still the same in France about gender issues in comparison with United Kingdom ? For me we are kind of the same problems right here but i can explain what's for me the main differences. First of all and the same than UK, we got on the past a female prime minister called Edith Cresson. But she stayed only one year. Also, in 1999, government voted a fifty-fifty deal to have on parliament an equal share between men and women. Unfortunately, nowadays political parties prefer to pay a fee and let much more mens at parliament. On working life, i think that the situation are improving for woman. Pay inequalities still but women are getting more key responsibilities especially on companies management. About private life, for me things are probably a little bit less advanced in France. Unfortunately women still expecting that men invite and pay everything at the restaurant.

      In France, there are now strictest laws to drive than 20 years ago. I think thats a good think because they were lots of death and accidents. For example, now its prohibited to drive if you have more than 0.5 g alcohol in blood.Thats mean that you cant drink more than 2 glasses alcohol before driving. If you are controlled and you have more than the legal level, you must pay a fine and sometimes you can also lose the drivers license. I think thats not enough because sometimes when Im with friends , I dont take care , I think its ok , I can drive I think that the best is to do like in England : 0 alcohol when we drive.

I told them too that we wrap the project up in four weeks and that everything's going much better now. See you soon, Tatiana

      Well, to improve our management strategies, we need to have some effective techniques, and develop them in the company. First, we must stop wasting our time to do useless thing. I'm not meaning we have to forbid break times, but we need to keep concentrate on what we're doing. For instance, don't take any personal calls at work, or set a day without any meetings, at least once a week. With that solution, the management team will have time to focus on other things, like development strategies with others departments of the company. An other strategy could be the following : be willing to do some extra hours when we're coming to the end of a project. I know, it's not something easy to do, especially for people who have a family, but if we do that, the management team will also have some extra time to see what was right and what was wrong during the developmet, and help people to improve what's need to be, for the following projects.

Give a frisbee to each player; he can take two shots on each turn. Give all 10 turns to players.

      Have you already listened to 'Home Improvement' by Josh Woodward? Josh has used a light simple style with a pleasant guitar work.

We throw a frisbee and each player has two shots on each turn. When each pin knock down, you have one point. The player who wins, is whom has most points. If you knock down all the bottles, you takes more shots and the points are added together.

I spent 2 weeks there : is was very exciting and interesting. But I had a scary story to tell you as were were flying back to Europe. The fly was very smooth but, after a duration of 6 hours, both engine flammed out suddenly! During the first seconds, there was a big silence then it turned quickly in an awfull mess in the cabin. Then, the captain said it remained no fuel in the tanks !!! Fortunally, as we were in the middle of Atlantic ocean, the pilots performed a perfect landing on a small Assores Island. Many days after, I heard that pilots confused kilograms with pounds to calculate their need of fuel! It's a scary story, but all passengers were also lucky !

      About two years ago, the Japanese had the biggest earthquake in history which was measured 9.0 on the Richter scale. This earthquake caused the giant tsunami and the serial explosion of nuclear plants in Fukushima. Many people were killed and injured, and most of people lost their home. At that moment, I was in France watching TV news. My friends in Japan came to mind and I got very scared and worried. I called them and sent them messages to assure their safety. Fortunately, all of my friends were safe. After have assured my friends' safety, I donated some money to an association who helps the victims of the disaster. I hope the victims get back to normal life soon.

      There're many different opinions about EU.There're still those who are skeptical about yhe whole idea,and especially about the Eurozone-particularly after financial problems with Greec debts. They argue that there is just too much diversity involved,that there are just too many inequalities in the union.They argue that ,e.g.the economic potential of Germany is not comparable with Greec potential.They say that each country is unique ,i.e. each has its own cultural and economic heritage,and it will lead to failure in the end. On the other hand ,supporters of the EU argue yhat there is strength in numbers.In other words a single ,large market is much more powerful than many individual smaller markets.They also argue that the adoption of the euro in the Eurozone allowed all the member countries to more easily do business with one another.An added plus that the single currency allowed the Eurozone to play hardball with countries ,e.g. the US and China.

      I think that in my country, in France, children are watching really too much the TV, and they are not always watching a program for their age. They feel boring about read a book, or going outside with their friends. And for the other, programs in the evening are always the same, detective story, like NCIS, FBI, and some other. And if you don't like that, you just can watch silly reality show or boring soap opera. It would be better, with some different movies, comedy, action, or anything else, but real movies

      I just heard a song by Josh Woodward called &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. What an great song, orchestrated with guitar and drums!  The melody is catching and the singer has a great voice. The pace can be a bit annoying, but the sing is interesting. It talks about damage of progress. I think the lyrics is a little sad but they're a good critique of progress. This is a protest song who recalled the values of the past. It says that the meaning of life is not in wealth. Anyway, you could listen to a day where you have blues because you feel alone agains the consumer society.

      In my country, a lot of laws have been written by the government these last years. For example, we aren't allowed smoking in the private area such as buildings, school, restaurants... but we still can smoke in the street. I know that's prohibited in USA. But some of the laws are very silly. When there is a brunch in the workplace, we have to throw some food who haven't been eaten by employees. Nobody can bring some food at home. It's outrageous. Actually, this rule has been compiled by the first French minister three years ago. I don't talk to you about the other laws in french.

      In the country where I live, Tv is not as violent as in the USA. There are also many channels and we can choose the program we want to watch. For an example, when I feel tired and busy, I prefer watching sitcom to relax. But, the only thing I can't stand is tha quality of our news : I think that, nowaday, there are no neutral journalist. All news on TV are influenced by the gouvernment or audience and the informations influence people who doesn't have critical attention. I think that news in France don't show the real international information witch can improve our own way to see the real world.

      My life right now isn't really hectic. I live from paycheck to paycheck - when I can get one - and I'm often worried about my money. I can say I have a certain amount of stress. The thing is I've finished studies two years ago, and I couldn't start the job of my life yet. Although I can do whatever I want, go wherever I want to go and have a social life, it is not easy. I would like to be able to get my dream job, then to settle down. Once I do that, I could definitely start my lilfe. I'm still young, by the way I'm not really worried about my future. I know if I really want something to do of my life I'll do it, even if it takes more time than I expected. I won't stand the fact I let my chance passed in front of me without doing anything to take it. That's the worst thing I could do.

      Hi shelley, Following your email, I'm so glad to answer for you. It was a great time spent on holidays with you, so I have to carrying this witty object out to mark these moments for ever. As I've read you, the design is like a C-shaped, a man inside with square face holding both arms towards the sky. Furthermore, he's getting some confident almond-shaped eyes with a symmetrical body's shape. It reminds to me, the Vitruvian's man drawing by Leonardo Da Vinci because he's appearing highly strengthen without doubt with a magic of regenerate healing. He's wearing a tight skirt with an oval on his chest. It seems to me that I've already been spotted that into one of my dream. Not a nightmare, just an uplifting tale got off to anywhere. As a symbolic powerful beauty unfolded in red, yellow and brown colours like your gift! See you. Christophe.
